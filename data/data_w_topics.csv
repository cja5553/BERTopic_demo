"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war rages, hostages talks, Gaza crisis",israel conflict,"Bill Burns, director of the CIA, is expected to meet with officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar to discuss a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas, according to a US official familiar with the plans.

The meetings come amid intensive discussions on the parameters of a new deal that would pair hostages’ release with a cessation in the fighting in Gaza. The meetings are expected to be held in Europe, the official said.

US officials said they remain focused on securing a release of hostages after a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar drew anger from the Gulf state.

"January 25, 2024 Israel-Hamas war",israel conflict,"Palestinians flee Khan Younis, moving toward Rafah, in the wake of the Israeli ground operation, in the southern Gaza , on Thursday, January 25. Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters

As the Gaza war nears its fifth month, with more than 25,000 Palestinians – civilians and combatants – dead and Israel nowhere close to achieving its objective of destroying Hamas, no one seems to have come up with a concrete proposal that’s palatable to both parties to pause the conflict, let alone end it. But there are suggestions, however half-baked, from both sides, that show a willingness to talk.

Indeed, Qatar — the main go-between — says there are “serious discussions” with Israel and Hamas, and is receiving “constant replies” from both sides. They’re not “negotiations” yet, says the White House. But with indirect talks ongoing, we seem to be inching toward what Ofer Shelah, Senior Researcher with Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), describes as a “Zopa” — a zone of possible agreement.

On Monday Axios reported Israel had proposed a two-month truce in exchange for the release of all the 100-plus hostages still held in Gaza. Later that day CNN learned that Mossad chief David Barnea had suggested allowing Hamas leaders to go into exile as part of a broader ceasefire.

On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal said Hamas was now open to releasing some of the hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. And Reuters reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed in principle to a one-month truce, during which abductees would be freed and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails released.

January 25 - 2024 campaign updates,election,"Former President Donald Trump arrives for a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Saturday, January 20. Matt Rourke/AP

Donald Trump’s New Hampshire triumph puts him on a GOP primary tier few, if any, Republicans have reached. Unofficial returns at time of publication have the former president at about 55% of the vote.

He’s only the second nonincumbent Republican to win a majority of the GOP primary vote in New Hampshire in the modern era. The only other was Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Trump’s 55% surpasses Reagan’s 50.2%. He is also just the second nonincumbent Republican to win the New Hampshire primary twice in the modern era. The other Republican was John McCain.

The fact that Trump was able to win both Iowa and New Hampshire is quite unusual. No other nonincumbent Republican has ever done it. Mitt Romney in 2012 came the closest (winning New Hampshire but losing Iowa by 24 votes) – and he took less than 40% in New Hampshire and under 25% of the vote in Iowa.

Trump’s ability to win Iowa and New Hampshire with such ease tells you how strong his candidacy is among Republicans. He appeals to different parts of the party, as evidenced by the fact that he succeeded in two very different contests in two fairly different states:

Iowa is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate.

is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate. New Hampshire sees a relatively high turnout primary that openly invites registered independents (or undeclared voters). The Granite State voters are more moderate, far less religious and wealthier than Iowa's.

Put another way, New Hampshire should have been a far worse state for Trump. His biggest backers look a lot more like the Iowa electorate than New Hampshire voters: conservatives, religious Republicans and Republicans of more modest financial means.

But none of that stopped Trump from pulling in the largest share of the vote for an non-incumbent in New Hampshire GOP primary history. It seems quite plausible at this point that Trump may pull off the ultimate historic GOP primary win: becoming the first non-incumbent Republican to go undefeated in all 50 states during the primary season.","['campaign', '25', 'primary', 'republican', 'nonincumbent', 'updates', 'iowa', 'trump', '2024', 'voters', 'republicans', 'hampshire', 'gop', 'win']"

"U.S. and China are working to make the business environment less volatile, Beijing says",economy,"The flags of China, U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party are displayed in a flag stall at the Yiwu Wholesale Market in Yiwu, Zhejiang province, China, May 10, 2019. Aly Song | Reuters

BEIJING — China and the U.S. are working toward creating a more stable and predictable environment for businesses, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Friday. Since U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's visit to China last summer, the two countries have agreed to hold regular meetings at the ministerial level and below. Wang and Raimondo had a call earlier this month. That communication ""strives to create a good environment for the two countries' economic and trade cooperation, especially in stabilizing business expectations,"" Wang said in Mandarin at a press conference, translated by CNBC. He did not mention U.S. tech restrictions, but said sanctions bring business uncertainty and ""greatly increase"" compliance costs. In the last two years, the Biden administration has issued export controls that limit the ability of Chinese companies to buy advanced tech such as high-end semiconductors from U.S. businesses. Washington has said it's a way to keep China's military from accessing cutting-edge tech, while maintaining areas of cooperation.

""We always believe that the common interests of China and the U.S. in economy and trade are far greater than their differences,"" Wang said. U.S. and other foreign businesses in China have long complained of challenges to doing business in the Asian country, such as unequal treatment of foreign companies compared to local players. More recently, international businesses have said Beijing's vague rules around data transfer out of the country make operations difficult. In the fall, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued new draft rules that said no government oversight is needed for data exports if regulators haven't stipulated that it qualifies as ""important."" The move was widely seen as an improvement for foreign businesses, but no official policy has yet followed. When asked Friday for an update on data rules, Wang only said the ""primary ministry is stepping up efforts to release them."" He said China has acted on a 24-point plan released last summer for supporting foreign businesses in the country — with implementation or progress on ""more than 60%"" of the measures. Wang also said the ministry has set up regular channels for foreign businesses to share feedback. When Raimondo visited China last year, she called for more action to improve predictability for U.S. businesses in China. Referring to the 24-point plan, she had said: ""Any one of those could be addressed as a way to show action.""

Growing international challenges

China's economic growth has slowed from the double-digit pace of prior decades to a 5.2% increase in 2023. Growth is expected to slow further this year. Wang told reporters Friday that this year, the international trade situation would be ""even more complex and severe,"" pointing to factors such as increased geopolitical tensions. Foreign direct investment fell by 8% to 1.13 trillion yuan ($160 billion) in 2023, the lowest level in three years, according to Ministry of Commerce data. It did not specify how much the U.S. invested in China, while noting France and the U.K. saw the largest increases in such investment last year.","['trade', 'foreign', 'rules', 'beijing', 'business', 'ministry', 'working', 'international', 'volatile', 'businesses', 'data', 'wang', 'environment', 'china', 'tech']"
LVMH shares jump 8% as earnings point to luxury sector resilience,economy,"Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, speaks during a press conference to present the 2023 annual results of LVMH in Paris, France, January 25, 2024.

LVMH shares jumped more than 8% on Friday morning, after the world's largest luxury group posted higher-than-expected sales for 2023 and raised its annual dividend.

The owner of Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, as well as brands including Givenchy, Bulgari and Sephora, on Thursday night reported sales amounting to 86.15 billion euros ($93.34 billion) for 2023, exceeding consensus forecasts and equating to 13% organic growth from the previous year.

Organic revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter.

The result was boosted in particular by 14% annual growth in the critical fashion and leather goods sector, along with 11% growth in perfumes and cosmetics. Wines and spirits meanwhile posted a 4% decline.

""Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,"" Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement.

""While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams.""

After a boom during the pandemic, the luxury sector endured a rough end to 2023 as challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions weighed on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S. and China.

LVMH in April 2023 became the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value, but a share price decline over the last six months allowed it to be eclipsed as Europe's largest company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

British luxury brand Burberry earlier this month issued a profit warning in response to slowing demand, as the balloon in high-end spending that peaked during the pandemic loses air. At the time, the news sent Burberry shares plunging and dragged down the wider sector.

Yet luxury stocks broadly advanced on Thursday as investors took heart from LVMH's reassuring results. Burberry's own shares were up 1.7% Friday morning.

Javier Gonzalez Lastra, portfolio manager of the Tema Luxury ETF, told CNBC on Thursday that investors are trying to gauge where the bottom of the earnings cycle revision is for the luxury sector. He predicted that earnings are ""likely to get tougher"" through the first half of 2024 because of last year's unusually high annual comparisons.

Arnault, however, is pinning some hope on LVMH's partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympics, which he said ""provides a new opportunity to reinforce our global leadership position in luxury goods and promote France's reputation for excellence around the world.","['sector', 'annual', 'luxury', 'lvmh', 'earnings', 'growth', 'billion', 'shares', 'resilience', '2024', 'point', '2023', 'vuitton', 'jump']"
Shein rejects Amazon 'clone' talk as it prepares for U.S. listing,economy,"Chinese-founded online retail giant Shein is not positioning itself as an Amazon ""clone,"" the company told CNBC, ahead of its hotly anticipated U.S. public listing later this year.

The e-commerce company's product categories are likely to ""grow over time,"" as the business entrenches itself deeper into the U.S., Peter Pernot-Day, head of strategic communications, U.K. and U.S., said. But that expansion will vary from market to market, and skew heavily toward Generation Z — born between the late 1990s and early 2000s — and younger Millennial consumers, who were born between the early 1980s and late 1990s.

""I don't see us an an Amazon clone per se,"" Pernot-Day said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The Singapore-headquartered fashion brand has already ventured into product lines as diverse as electronics, sports and home appliances, after winning over millions of U.S. shoppers during the pandemic with its low-cost and seemingly limitless clothing lines.

It is now forecast to supersede high street rivals H&M and Zara owner Inditex, with estimated revenues of $24 billion in the first nine months of 2023, according to tech publication The Information.

""One of the things we are very good at is measuring and responding to customer demand and that flexibility allows us to tailor our offering to different geographies,"" Pernot-Day said.

""So, product categories vary across these markets. But the core point is that being receptive and responsive to Generation Z, younger Millennial shoppers, is something that leads to growth,"" he added.","['late', 'shein', 'amazon', 'clone', 'product', 'vary', 'listing', 'talk', 'millennial', 'pernotday', 'z', 'market', 'generation', 'prepares', 'younger', 'rejects', 'shoppers']"
AI hiring frenzy to fuel layoffs in other tech segments as firms strive to balance costs,economy,"Stick figures image displayed on a laptop screen and a binary code displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on January 24, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

As tech firms prioritize investments into artificial intelligence and go on a hiring spree, other segments are likely to see layoffs continue into 2024, according to industry experts.

More than 20,000 tech employees have already lost jobs so far in 2024, according to tracker layoffs.fyi.

""Google and the rest of Big Tech are betting big on AI while cutting back on non-strategic areas. Layoffs will continue to happen for Big Tech in some areas while the hiring frenzy in AI will be unprecedented as this arms race continues across the tech world,"" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai last week warned employees there would be more job cuts this year as the company continues to shift investments toward AI.

""We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,"" Pichai wrote in a Jan. 17 memo to employees, adding that the management was gearing up to share its AI goals and objectives for 2024. ""The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,"" Pichai said.

'Unshirkable responsibility': China's financial institutions urged to support property developers,economy,"China's financial institutions should provide strong support to the country's beleaguered real estate sector and not ""blindly withdraw"" financing for projects facing difficulties, according to a senior Chinese financial regulatory official.

His strongly worded comments follow the Chinese central bank's largest cut in mandatory cash reserves for banks since 2021. Beijing also recently released a fresh policy mandate aimed at easing the cash crunch for Chinese developers, which have struggled under the crackdown on the sector's bloated debt.

""The financial industry has an unshirkable responsibility and must provide strong support,"" said Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of China's National Financial Regulatory Administration, at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday, according to a CNBC translation.

""We all know the real estate industry chain is long and involves a wide range of areas. It has an important impact on the national economy and is closely related to people's lives,"" he added.

Commodity markets are in a 'super squeeze' — and higher prices could be here to stay,economy,"SUIXI, CHINA - DECEMBER 30: An employee works on the production line of aluminum foil at a workshop of Anhui Limu New Material Technology Co., Ltd on December 30, 2023 in Suixi County, Huaibei City, Anhui Province of China.

Global commodity markets are in a ""super squeeze"" amid supply disruptions and lack of investment — and it's only going to get worse as geopolitical and climate risks exacerbate the situation, HSBC said. ""For some time now we have described global commodity markets as being in a 'super-squeeze,'"" its chief economist Paul Bloxham told CNBC. A commodity ""super squeeze"" is denoted by higher prices driven by supply constraints more than a robust growth in demand, he explained. ""If it's a supply constraint that's driving high commodity prices, it's a very different story for global growth,"" said via Zoom. Higher prices as a result of a super squeeze are ""not as positive."" ""We see the deeper 'super-squeeze' factors on the supply-side as still set to play a key role in keeping commodity prices elevated,"" he said, outlining factors like political uncertainties, climate change and the lack of investments into the green energy transition.

The super squeeze could be deeper, or more prolonged if geopolitical, climate change or energy transition related supply disruptions are larger than expected. Paul Bloxham HSBC chief economist

Geopolitical risks include the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza and the Ukraine war, which have hampered global trade, as seen in shipping disruptions from the recent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Another reason is climate change, which disrupts supply chains as well as commodities supply, especially in the agricultural space. ""The super squeeze could be deeper, or more prolonged if geopolitical, climate change or energy transition related supply disruptions are larger than expected,"" he added.

Lack of investments

The world's pursuit of a net-zero carbon future is fueling demand for energy transition metals such as copper and nickel, Bloxham pointed out. However, there are insufficient investments allocated to procuring these critical minerals, leading to a sharper supply squeeze on energy transition metals — in particular copper, aluminum and nickel, he said. As energy transition ramps up, markets could be looking at a shortage of a slew of metals like graphite, cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium in the next decade, the Energy Transitions Commission said in a report in July.

watch now

At the recent COP28 climate change conference, more than 60 countries backed a plan to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, in what is largely deemed as a step forward for energy transition and a further boost in demand for metals required for that transition. ""Large-scale mining projects can take 15-20 years, and the last decade has seen a lack of investment in exploration and production for key energy transition materials,"" the report said. Annual capital investments in these metals averaged $45 billion in the last two decades, and must rise to around $70 billion each year through to 2030 to ensure an ample stream of supply, according to the ETC report.

Commodities are notoriously volatile asset classes, with a long history that is prone to a short squeeze and the current landscape points to more of the same. Brian Luke S&P Dow Jones Indices

Without more investment in new capacities, supply will be constrained, HSBC's Bloxham said, adding that ""for any given amount of demand,"" it should be expected that commodity prices will stay more elevated than in the past. ""That seems to be playing out across many of the commodities at the moment."" Technology could also be a gamechanger if a development came along and made it much easier to extract the metals used in the battery space, Bloxham added.

He did not say how long it will take global commodity markets to move out of the squeeze, but one way out of it — which would also push commodity prices lower — is a ""bigger and deeper [economic] downturn globally,"" he said. ""Commodities are notoriously volatile asset classes, with a long history that is prone to a short squeeze and the current landscape points to more of the same,"" said Brian Luke, senior director and head of commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. He highlighted that extreme weather events and geopolitics have also impacted the agricultural and energy commodity baskets.

Metals most impacted

Analysts say metals will likely see the most upside. Bloxham noted that aside from clean energy metals, iron ore was also on his list due to falling inventory and a lack of investments into expanding capacity. Iron ore has seen a price jump of over 24% in the last year, according to data from FactSet. The benchmark 62%-grade iron ore last traded at $135.48 per ton. ""The reason why [iron ore] has a sudden squeeze-up is because inventory has been very low,"" said Bank of America Securities' head of Asia -Pacific basic materials, Matty Zhao. She noted that in spite of China's property crisis, steel production has continued, fueling demand for iron ore and coking coal, which are integral to steelmaking. China, which makes around 55% of the world's steel, produced 874.7 million tons of steel in the first 10 months of 2023 — up 1.4% across the same period in 2022.

In order to drive the progress and development of innovative solutions that tackle climate change and help the environment, there needs to be regulatory frameworks in place that help companies make bolder steps forward, top industry CEOs told CNBC. Ester Baiget, the CEO of biosolutions firm Novozymes, said that ""roadblocks"" usually stand in the way of companies producing sustainable solutions which needed to be removed. ""We need to work more with authorities to create the framework that we can move bolder … faster,"" Baiget said on an ""IOT: Powering the digital economy"" panel moderated by CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""We have a regulation which is based on the past,"" she added, pointing out that in her own sector it can take six years to register a new microbe (or microorganism) to replace fertilizers, for example.

Microbes have been put forward as an alternative to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The runoff from these synthetic fertilizers can also cause damage to waterways. However, new microbial fertilizers need to go through regulatory approval before going to market.

Rethinking regulation

During the same panel discussion last week, Ilham Kadri, the CEO of chemical science company Syensqo , also highlighted the issues with current regulation around sustainability. She said that ""the road to carbon neutrality is long, is costly, is not easy. We need to rethink regulation in regions like Europe."" Kadri also said there was a ""lack of competitiveness in Europe,"" referring to the difficulties faced by her sector.

"After earnings miss, Cramer says Tesla's out of the Magnificent Seven",economy,"After reviewing Tesla's earnings, CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday criticized CEO Elon Musk and told investors why he thinks the electric vehicle giant has lost its spot among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks.

""As someone who was among the first to vocalize the Magnificent Seven rubric, I officially acknowledge now that there are only six left,"" he said.

Tesla's Wednesday report missed Wall Street's expectations and warned of a slowdown in 2024, sending its stock plummeting, down 12% by Thursday's close.

To Cramer, there are a number of factors revealed during earnings that alienate Tesla from its magnificent peers — Apple , Nvidia , Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet and Meta — including the fact that the company predicted ""notably"" slower growth this year. Tesla also faces intense competition from Chinese competitors, and Musk admitted that without trade barriers, these foreign manufacturers will ""pretty much demolish most other companies."" And according to Cramer, the other six aren't hostage to the performance of the broader economy, while Tesla purported many customers can't afford its vehicles.

Cramer also criticized Tesla's leadership, saying top management of great companies show they're committed to the success of their enterprise. Musk, however, indicated he doesn't want to grow the company's artificial intelligence and robotics sector unless he has more influence. Musk is asking for 25% voting control, nearly double his current stake. Cramer was also not pleased with Musk's earnings call reassurance that this larger stake wouldn't be so much ""that I can control the company even if I go bonkers.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Oh, thank heavens, you don't have a Magnificent Seven CEO who might go bonkers and, more important, what if he doesn't get his 25% voting power?"" Cramer asked.

Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,economy,"Pat Gelsinger, CEO Intel, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box at the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 16th, 2024.

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.

Here's how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:

Earnings per share : 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected

: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts that the core businesses — PC and server chips — would be at the low end of the the company's seasonal range in the current quarter, but that overall sales would take a hit because of weakness in subsidiaries including Mobileye and its programmable chip unit, as well as revenue decreases from other businesses the company has spun off or sold.

""The core business we see as healthy,"" Gelsinger said. ""We see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger.""

Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.

With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel's gross margin was 40%, down 2.6 percentage points annually.

Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.

Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia's recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.

""The data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters,"" said Intel CFO David Zinsner on a call with analysts on Thursday.

Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.

""The quarter capped a year of tremendous progress on Intel's transformation,"" Gelsinger said in a statement. Intel said on Thursday that it would restate past results under a new system where Intel has to account for costs related to internal manufacturing of its own chips.

Intel Foundry Services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.

Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Zinsner said that Intel had cut $3 billion in costs last year and the company spun off or sold five different business lines.

Intel's largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.

Gelsinger said that demand for PC chips had ""normalized,"" and that sales were strong in the gaming and commercial sectors. He added that Intel expects the total PC market to expand this year.

Intel's second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel's Network and Edge department, which sells parts for carriers and networking, reported $1.5 billion in sales, down 24% from last year.

Zinsner said that Intel expected its Data Center business to decline ""double-digit"" percentages sequentially in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.

Intel said it paid $3.1 billion in dividends in 2023.

He urged his disappointed young supporters, some of them crying, not to give up, and framed himself as a one-man social movement crusading for political change. ""For me, over the last 10 years, whether I was in office or standing for election, I have always regarded it as a social movement aimed at changing political culture. Since this social movement has not fully materialized, let's keep working hard,"" the former Taipei City Mayor told supporters in Mandarin. While he may have finished last in the first competitive three-way race for the Taiwan presidency since 2000, Ko garnered more than a quarter of the popular vote — disrupting the usual stranglehold of the dominant political parties, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang. The 63-year-old clearly resonated with the young and educated as he spoke plainly into their everyday bread-and-butter issues, including soaring housing costs and stagnant wages at a time of high inflation. ""We need to take Ko's rise very seriously,"" Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant professor in government at Franklin and Marshall College, told CNBC. ""There is a clear social base rooting for him and willing to support his populist discourse. These are anti-establishment attitudes. Is Taiwan seeing the rise of populism?""

These shades of populism, along with his shifting political affiliations in the past, contrast against Ko's self-association with the conviction and idealism of youth-led social movements in Taiwan. A populist, often seen as anti-establishment and anti-elitism, can sometimes be deemed a threat to democracy; Ko has paradoxically aligned himself to past social movements in Taiwan that have enhanced the island's nascent democracy. Once a leading organ transplant surgeon in Taiwan, Ko went from being aligned with the DPP in 2014 when he entered the race as an independent running for the Taipei mayorship, to nearly entering an alliance with main opposition party KMT in the most recent presidential election.

Taiwan's young and restless

In any case, Taiwan's two major parties now face a battle to cater to younger voters that could come at the expense of older votes or a focus on broader strategic interests. ""My sense is that Ko's personality and affect — his bluntness and willingness to criticize the existing parties, his position as a political outsider, etc.— appeal to people who feel disengaged with the traditional parties,"" said Sara Newland, an assistant professor in government at Smith College. ""He has also given voice to and amplified the idea that both the KMT and the DPP are ignoring the main domestic concerns of voters, and that kind of populist messaging appeals to people who feel like Taiwan's current economic and political system is not benefiting them,"" she added.

In the final My Formosa poll released before a ban on opinion polls kicked in prior to Election Day, 53.7% of respondents aged 20-29 indicated they would vote Ko for president. Overall, 21.8% of all respondents in that poll indicated they would vote for Ko — lower than the eventual 26.46% of the popular vote he earned at the Jan. 13 election. A similar breakdown on the election outcome was not immediately available. ""Even though the DPP emerged out of the underground pro-democracy movement under martial law, young people now see them as traditional and part of the political establishment,"" Newland said.

Political opportunism

Even though Ko lost the presidential race to Lai Ching-te from the ruling DPP, the Taiwan People's Party — founded only in 2019 — won eight seats in the 113-seat Legislative Yuan and now holds the balance of power when the new parliament take office Feb. 1. In a split parliament where the two major parties do not have a clear majority, one of them will need to form a coalition government with TPP.

The KMT, Beijing's preferred political partner, has 52 seats. The ruling DPP has 51, while independents hold the remaining two. Ko's party is ""ideologically nebulous,"" said Ming-sho Ho, a sociology professor at National Taiwan University who studies the working class and social movements. ""Ko once vowed to follow Tsai Ing-wen's foreign policy, but at the same time maintained that 'both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family' — these things just don't add up,"" he said, referring to the island's incumbent Democratic president from the DPP. ""Ko is indeed opportunistically arguing different things at the same time.""

The DPP has rejected the so-called ""1992 Consensus"" — a tacit agreement between the then-KMT government and Chinese Communist Party officials that China and Taiwan belong to ""one China,"" and the basis of Beijing's approach to cross-Straits engagement. China has never relinquished its claim over Taiwan — which has been self-governing since the Chinese nationalist party, or Kuomintang, fled to the island following its defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949. Chinese President Xi Jinping regards reunification with the mainland as ""a historical inevitability.""

Ko's association with Taiwan's recent history of activism — driven by young people and civil society — could therefore be deemed opportunistic. From the Wild Lily and Wild Strawberry movements to the Sunflower movement, Taiwan's road to democracy and reform has been marked by student-led social movements in the last few decades. The Wild Lily movement in 1990 was seen as pivotal to the self-governing island's first direct, democratic presidential and legislative elections in 1996, while the Wild Strawberry movement in 2008 emerged out of a protest against alleged police violence and abuse of power.

Ho from the National Taiwan University pointed out that ""the Sunflower Movement was of course a consequential event that contributed to the DPP's victory in the 2014 local election and the 2016 presidential election. But as the time passed by, the effect waned."" During the Sunflower movement in 2014, young protesters temporarily took control of the national legislature in protest against a free trade agreement with China which the then-ruling KMT government tried to ratify in an undemocratic manner. Protesters feared the agreement would lead to a greater dependence on China. ""Nevertheless, I would say the core values that undergirded the Sunflower Movement — such as the assertion of Taiwanese identity, the rejection of incorporation into a China-centered economy, and young people's claim about rising inequalities — still remain till now,"" he said, adding that these values ""no longer empower the DPP."" While those same values may have driven TPP at this elections, Taiwanese have also voted for other third-party candidates in the past — but they often fall by the wayside, unable to break the rotating KMT-DPP grip on power.

"Probe into GM's Cruise finds poor leadership, culture issues at center of accident response",economy,"Culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership at General Motors' Cruise autonomous vehicle unit were at the center of regulatory oversights and coverup concerns that have plagued the company since October, according to the findings of a third-party probe.

The report addresses, in part, controversy that has swirled around Cruise since an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a separate vehicle. Results of the investigation, which reviewed whether Cruise representatives misled investigators or members of the media in discussing the incident, were published Thursday in a 105-page report.

Despite the findings, which pointed to widespread issues with company culture, the third-party probe found that the evidence to date ""does not establish that Cruise leadership or personnel intended to deceive or mislead regulators"" during briefings a day after the accident, according to a summary of the report released by Cruise.

Cruise remains under investigation by several entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Several Cruise leaders and employees — most of whom are no longer employed by the company — attempted to show regulators a video of the incident, according to the findings, but were only able to do so in one of several initial meetings due to connection or ""video transmission issues."" Although the intent to share the information had been there, the report found, the Cruise representatives subsequently failed to properly inform some regulators or officials of everything that occurred.

""The problem is that when the video froze, literally and figuratively, the Cruise employees froze in the moment, and nobody thought to speak up and fill in the detail,"" a person close to the investigation told CNBC.

Some employees also failed to update or correct company statements that omitted such information and attempted to deflect blame on the human hit-and-run driver who initially struck the pedestrian.

The report outlines multiple instances in which then-CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, who resigned in late November, made the final calls to withhold information, specifically regarding media.","['culture', 'issues', 'findings', 'poor', 'information', 'cruise', 'center', 'probe', 'company', 'regulators', 'employees', 'report', 'finds', 'leadership', 'investigation', 'video', 'gms', 'response']"
WWE boss Vince McMahon accused of sexual assault and trafficking in new lawsuit,others,"TKO Executive Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon is seen during a ceremony announcing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has joined the Board of Directors for TKO at New York Stock Exchange on January 23, 2024 in New York City.

WWE boss Vince McMahon was accused in a graphic lawsuit Thursday of sexual assault, trafficking, and physical and emotional abuse of a woman who previously worked at the pro wrestling giant.

The suit by Janel Grant — which alleges McMahon directed her to have sex with a WWE ""superstar"" and other men — seeks to void a nondisclosure agreement Grant said she reached with McMahon in early 2022.

Grant's suit in U.S. District Court in Connecticut says the billionaire McMahon agreed to pay her $3 million as part of that deal, but ended up only paying her $1 million in exchange for her silence about his conduct.

In addition to McMahon, 78, the complaint names as defendants WWE and John Laurinaitis, the company's former head of talent relations and general manager.

The complaint comes six months after federal law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on McMahon and served him with a grand jury subpoena as part of an investigation into McMahon's payment of millions of dollars to multiple women, among them Grant, after allegations of sexual misconduct.

McMahon, who resigned from WWE leadership posts in mid-2022 amid an internal company investigation, only to return as its leader in early 2023, last March paid WWE $17.4 million to cover costs of a probe of those payouts by a law firm retained by the company.

McMahon is executive chairman of the board of TKO Group Holdings , which was formed last year by a merger of his wrestling company and the mix-martial arts company UFC. He owns a significant number of shares in TKO Group.

Grant's lawyer, Ann Callis, in a statement, said, ""Today's complaint seeks to hold accountable two WWE executives who sexually assaulted and trafficked Plaintiff Janel Grant, as well as the organization that facilitated or turned a blind eye to the abuse and then swept it under the rug.""

""She is an incredibly private and courageous person who has suffered deeply at the hands of Mr. McMahon and Mr. Laurinaitis,"" Callis said. ""Ms. Grant hopes that her lawsuit will prevent other women from being victimized. The organization is well aware of Mr. McMahon's history of depraved behavior, and it's time that they take responsibility for the misconduct of its leadership.""

A spokesman for McMahon said, ''This lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and a vindictive distortion of the truth.""

""He will vigorously defend himself,"" the spokesman said.

A TKO Group spokesperson said, ""Mr. McMahon does not control TKO nor does he oversee the day-to-day operations of WWE.""

""While this matter pre-dates our TKO executive team's tenure at the company, we take Ms. Grant's horrific allegations very seriously and are addressing this matter internally,"" the TKO spokesperson said.

TKO Group on Tuesday announced that Netflix would pay $5 billion over 10 years to stream the WWE's flagship program ""Raw,"" and carry all other WWE shows and specials outside the United States.

A WWE spokesman and Laurinaitis did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Grant's suit.","['assault', 'boss', 'suit', 'company', 'spokesman', 'mr', 'wwe', 'sexual', 'accused', 'tko', 'mcmahon', 'vince', 'grant', 'million', 'lawsuit', 'trafficking']"

Baidu AI Cloud will be integrating its Ernie chatbot into Samsung's Galaxy S24 smartphones, allowing users to translate calls in real time, among other features.

Ernie is the Chinese tech giant's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence technology that's able to generate humanlike responses to users' prompts.

It comes a week after Samsung revealed its latest Galaxy S24 lineup with AI-powered features as the South Korean electronics giant attempts to overtake the likes of Apple 's newest iPhones with the technology.

""Now featuring Ernie's understanding and generation capabilities, the upgraded Samsung Note Assistant can translate content and also summarize lengthy content into clear, intelligently organized formats at the click of a button, streamlining the organization of extensive text,"" the firms said in a statement.

Samsung was not among the top 5 smartphone vendors in China.

Apple was the largest smartphone vendor in China by shipments in 2023, and captured 17.3% of market share in the country, IDC data on Thursday showed. Honor came in second place with 16.8% market share, followed by Vivo, Huawei and Oppo.

The Ernie 4.0 version was launched on October.

Religious trips will fuel India’s tourism boom — airlines are gearing up with record aircraft orders,economy,"India's tourism sector is set for a boom as more travelers take trips around the country for religious purposes.

The South Asian country with the world's largest Hindu population could see an additional 50 million to 100 million tourists a year on account of the new Ram Mandir — a temple in the northern city of Ayodhya inaugurated on Monday — according to Jefferies.

This expected footfall in the new temple will be much higher than the annual numbers for the Taj Mahal (6.5 million) in India, Rome's Vatican City (9 million) and the Mecca in Saudi Arabia (20 million), the note showed.

Other religious sights in India such as the Tirupati Temple in Andhra Pradesh — 25 million visitors annually — and the Vaishno Devi Temple in Jammu and Kashmir — 8 million visitors per year — also hold a strong spiritual, historical and cultural significance in India, the investment bank said.

""Religious tourism is still the biggest segment of tourism in India … the creation of a new religious tourist centre (Ayodhya) with improved connectivity and infrastructure can create a meaningfully large economic impact,"" Jefferies highlighted.

Indian media reported that around half a million people visited the Ram temple on its opening day which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The YouTube broadcast of the opening ceremony on Modi's channel alone received more than 11 million views.

""The multiplier effect of travel is humongous. If it continues develop tourist destination including religious tourism, chances are that more and more people will come to visit India and it will even benefit on the foreign exchange side,"" said Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management.","['tourist', 'ram', 'opening', 'orders', 'boom', 'india', 'record', 'million', 'temple', 'gearing', 'visitors', 'trips', 'tourism', 'religious', 'inaugurated', 'indias', 'fuel', 'airlines']"

Lessons from a lifetime in investment,economy,"Print this page

Looking back over my five and a half decades exploring investment and finance, I have to ask the inevitable question: what have I learned from it all?

The period has been marked by a welter of financial innovation, regulatory change, booms and busts, banking crises, geopolitical tension and much else besides. From this protracted drama it is hard to extract a set of simple coherent lessons for investors. Yet I believe that there are some eternal verities in investment and finance. They are often counterintuitive and not always aligned with conventional economic wisdom.

My early education in investment started in the great bull market of the late 1960s, in which a heady pace was set by the so-called Nifty Fifty growth stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. In the brief period I spent in the City of London, becoming a chartered accountant, I had the good fortune to be sent on the audit of the Imperial Tobacco pension fund. This was run by one of the great investment gurus of the postwar period, the actuary George Ross Goobey.

When Ross Goobey went to the Imperial fund in 1947, pension funds were mainly invested in gilt-edged securities, which were regarded as safer than equities. In his view this was a nonsense.

Against the consensus

His thinking, he told me, was not based on sophisticated economics or actuarial legerdemain. He merely thought that the Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton’s 2.5 per cent fixed interest gilts were a swindle when inflation was running at more than 4 per cent. They could not, he thought, deliver the requisite returns to meet Imperial’s pension obligations.

Equities, by contrast, looked to him absurdly cheap. Ross Goobey managed the remarkable feat of persuading the fund’s trustees to let him invest in equities and dump the fund’s gilts.

In the bull market conditions of the late 1960s the Imperial fund’s portfolio struck me as bafflingly cumbersome. It contained nearly 900 holdings in mainly small and medium-sized — far from nifty — quoted UK companies. The fund was stuck with them regardless of their performance because Ross Goobey insisted his managers should never trade, only buy and hold.

Particularly unfathomable to me was his injunction to his managers to buy nothing that yielded less than 6 per cent. In a raging bull market this ensured exposure to some of the shakiest companies on the London Stock Exchange.

A few went bust in the subsequent recession. Yet, thanks to the policy of extreme diversification, the portfolio damage was marginal. In addition the high-yield injunction protected the fund from exposure to the most overvalued (and thus low-yielding) companies in the boom.

Here was an object lesson in the workings of diversification, though not quite as envisaged by economists such as Harry Markowitz, for whom the “free lunch” of diversification came primarily from spreading bets across different asset classes. Ross Goobey instead took a very risky bet on a single asset class while diversifying within it. The risk of capital loss was mitigated by the yield discipline he imposed.

So great were the returns that Imperial enjoyed pension contribution holidays for years. Other institutional investors followed suit by dropping gilts in favour of ordinary shares. Ross Goobey was credited with founding what came to be known as “the cult of the equity”.

Among the enduring lessons: diversification is an invaluable risk management tool. High yield, though often an indicator of dividend cuts to come, can be a good defence in an overheated market; equating risk with volatility, as so many economists do, may be less helpful, especially for private investors, than focusing on avoiding loss of capital. Meanwhile, reducing transaction costs by minimising share trading bolsters investment performance. That logic has turbocharged the rise of passive investing.

A decade of financial turbulence

The 1970s provided me with an induction course, first on the Investors Chronicle and The Times, then as financial editor of The Economist, in the dynamics of booms and busts. The unintended consequences of deregulation — a recurring theme in financial markets — helped shape what proved in economic and financial terms to be an exceptionally violent decade.

Exhibit A in the saga was US President Nixon’s cancellation in 1971 of the convertibility of the dollar into gold. The resulting deregulation of exchange rates unleashed volatile cross-border capital flows that caused wild swings in global asset prices. Exhibit B was the shift in the banking system from being a home for low-risk, highly regulated quasi-utilities — a product of the troubled 1930s — to an adventure playground in which bankers’ insatiable risk appetite was substantially liberated.

A radical and still instructive deregulatory experiment took place in the UK in 1971. The Bank of England scrapped quantitative ceilings on bank lending in favour of indirect controls, such as balance sheet ratios. This unleashed a wild acceleration of the money supply and credit. Excess liquidity poured into an overheating property market. Then came the 1973 oil crisis, soaring inflation, recession and financial crisis. Property, gilts and equities all plunged.

In equities, the dramatic share price collapse was driven by financial institutions’ selling. Their fear was not ill-founded. In confronting inflation, the Conservative government of prime minister Edward Heath removed key props of the capitalist system by adopting price, dividend and commercial rent controls.

At the same time companies faced not only spiralling wage bills but penal tax liabilities. This was because corporation tax was charged on paper profits from stock appreciation, the difference between the original cost of inventory and the inflated cost of replacing it. Result: British industry was going bust.

When Labour replaced the Tories in early 1974 chancellor Denis Healey intensified the corporate fiscal clamp. Yet by the autumn he had grasped that the corporate sector was being terminally throttled. He introduced tax relief for stock appreciation along with other breaks.

Timing the market

Policy U-turns often signal market turnarounds. Healey’s move to put British capitalism back on its feet should have ended the bear market. Yet in the fourth quarter of 1974, fearful insurance companies, pension funds, investment trusts and unit trusts together sold more shares than they bought for the first and last time during the decade.

Then on January 6 1975, after a peak-to-trough fall on the FTSE All-Share index of 72.9 per cent, the market inexplicably turned and rose vertically. It was impossible for the institutions to get back into the market without causing prices to move spectacularly against themselves.

That is a reminder of the futility, for most investors, of trying to time the market and of the difficulty of contrarianism, the art of investing against the consensus. Note, though, that Ross Goobey, hitherto an equity ideologue, once again defied convention.

When undated gilt yields reached 17 per cent in the mid-1970s the Imperial fund took a big bet on these government IOUs. Ross Goobey’s thinking was that if inflation came down this was an unbelievable bargain. But if the economy was going to hell in a handcart all bets were off anyway.

Of course, all bets are never off in financial markets, not least because when that becomes the common perception, gold comes into its own. There lies the case for the yellow metal as a hedge against catastrophe.

Why should this episode resonate with us today? While economists have explained exhaustively that we are not now reliving the 1970s the similarities remain more striking than the differences. Both periods saw supply side energy and commodity shocks, together with surging money supply. Governments turned on the fiscal tap in response.

Central bankers in both periods initially declared they could do nothing to curb an inflation induced by supply shortages. They were slow to see the demand side of the equation and the risk of second round effects in labour markets. And 21st century central banks’ economic models provided useless forecasts when confronted with supply shocks. So they fell back on a shaky, data-dependent (in other words, backward-looking) monetary policy.

One lesson is that investors, as well as central bankers, ignore money supply signals at their peril. Another is that in such inflationary periods government bonds cease to provide a diversifying hedge against supposedly riskier assets.

Dotcom delirium

Fast forward, now, to the second half of the 1990s, by which time I had been writing for the FT for a decade and a half. The dotcom boom was turning into a bubble, once again making a nonsense of mainstream economists’ belief that markets are “efficient” or reflect fair market values.

An important psychological factor in the tech euphoria was “Fomo” (fear of missing out) which goes back in history at least as far as the South Sea Bubble of the early 18th century. Fomo adds to investors’ myopia over the risk of capital loss.

For professional investors fear of missing out is more a matter of business and career risk. They are usually benchmarked against an index or peer group. So if they stand against a bubble and underperform the index, clients defect and they may be fired.

This was the fate of Tony Dye, the former chief investment officer of Phillips & Drew Fund Management, during the tech bubble. By shunning overvalued tech and going heavily into cash he seriously underperformed PDFM’s peer group, leading to his ousting just two weeks before the bubble burst. Small wonder fund managers tend to hug their benchmarks.

Central banks responded to the dotcom bust with rapid interest rate cuts. This cemented a view in the markets that policy was asymmetric. That is, the central banks would never lean against a bubble and would reliably extend a safety net when it burst.

The moral hazard implicit in asymmetric policy helped pave the way for the wild credit bubble of the 2000s (see below). Then came the great financial crisis of 2007-09. The central banks’ response was once again to come to the rescue and keep interest rates ultra low for a decade while buying up government bonds and other assets via so-called “quantitative easing”. A further round of propping up followed the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

By the post-crash 2010s the UK investment scene had reverted to something like the pattern that confronted George Ross Goobey after the second world war. Pension funds had run down their equity holdings to near-zero. Quirky accounting standards and pressure from The Pensions Regulator had pushed them into liability-driven investment. Instead of seeking to maximise the return on their assets, trustees sought to match their liabilities by buying what economists and actuaries described as “safe” government bonds.

Yet nothing in investment is ever safe — witness how the collapse in US Treasuries contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and other US regional banks last year. And the regulators’ attempts to make individual pension funds risk-free makes the overall market structure more risky: if everyone pursues the same strategy, when the market moves, it moves all one way. That eternal verity re-emerged in the pension fund crisis in the gilt market in 2022.

After a lifetime spent watching the markets, I am struck how, with each new cycle in which central banks act as lenders of last resort, debt mounts inexorably. We continue to muddle through. But a great debt denouement is inevitable because debt cannot rise faster than incomes for ever.

Since debt implosions are inherently deflationary — see Japan in the 1990s — gold, ever resilient against inflation, may not provide insurance against falling prices but government bonds certainly will. To conclude; it is tempting to quote the US economist Herbert Stein who remarked that if something can’t go on forever, then it will stop. But as I have remarked here before, the wise rejoinder by fellow economist Rudi Dornbusch was: yes, but it will go on for a lot longer than you anticipate.","['goobey', 'lifetime', 'lessons', 'fund', 'investment', 'financial', 'investors', 'risk', 'market', 'funds', 'pension', 'ross']"
Intel seen struggling to ‘find its footing’ as guidance miss sends stock tanking,economy,"Intel Corp.’s stock hasn’t seen a double-digit percentage decline in more than two years. But it might break that streak after a downbeat earnings forecast.

The company late Thursday issued an outlook for first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents on revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion. Both forecasts came up well shy of the FactSet consensus: Analysts had been modeling 34 cents in adjusted EPS along with revenue of $14.3 billion.

“While we expect a slightly sub-seasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG,” Intel INTC, +0.94% Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said on the earnings call, referring to the Programmable Solutions Group.

Furthermore, the company anticipates “a significant drop in [Intel Foundry Services] revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment-buying in the first half of the year,” he continued.

Intel’s stock fell 10.9% in after-hours action Thursday. If such a decline carried through to Friday’s close, it would mark the stock’s worst single-day percentage decline since Oct. 22, 2021, when it fell 11.7%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. After that, the worst drop was an 8.6% plunge seen July 29, 2022.

“We think Intel shares are justifiably selling off following soft [first-quarter] guidance that leaves us to question when the company will find its footing as competitors capitalize on an ongoing AI server [capital-expenditure] cycle,” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a note to clients.

The guidance miss comes as Intel’s stock has enjoyed a nice recent rally, surging about 50% since the company last posted results three months ago. The recent run in the share price “raised the bar on expectations,” an HSBC analyst wrote earlier this week.

Intel’s whiff on the outlook overshadowed better-than-expected results for the latest quarter, in which the company generated net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents a share, versus a loss of about $700 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-prior period. On an adjusted basis, Intel earned 54 cents a share, while analysts were modeling 45 cents a share.

“We expect to unlock further efficiencies in 2024 and beyond as we implement our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency and accountability and higher returns on our owners’ capital,” Zinsner said in a release.

Revenue climbed to $15.4 billion from $14.0 billion, whereas the FactSet consensus called for $15.2 billion.

Intel saw a 33% boost in revenue, to $8.8 billion, from its client-computing group, which is the company’s largest unit and the one that encompasses PCs. Analysts had been modeling $8.5 billion.

Revenue from the data-center and artificial-intelligence group was down 10% to $4.0 billion, while analysts were looking for $4.1 billion.

The company’s network and edge business saw a 24% drop in revenue, to $1.5 billion, relative to a year before. That total matched the FactSet consensus.

Meanwhile, Mobileye revenue increased 13% to $637 million, and foundry services revenue jumped 63% to $291 million.

The culprit? A slowdown in U.S. volumes into January, according to analysts.

Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev noted that Visa’s V, +0.35% U.S. payment volumes decelerated in the fiscal first quarter and in the first three weeks of January, a trend driven by debit transactions.

Visa

Baird analyst David Kallo said that while the deceleration in January U.S. volumes and total processed transactions was “not a huge surprise,” those trends could cause the stock to “pull back mildly tomorrow.”

Visa Chief Financial Officer Chris Suh said the January U.S. trends reflected one-off factors that weren’t indicative of broader spending issues. For example, areas like Kansas City and Dallas have seen extreme cold temperatures that have prevented people from going out and spending.

“We’ve seen weather-related patterns before,” he said. “It doesn’t give us major concern.”

As for the December-quarter volume trends, he said the slowdown was a matter of timing.

“Putting it all together, the step-down of about 80 basis points in total U.S. payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays,” he said on Visa’s earnings call.

“Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable,” he continued. “Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments.”

Investors, though, still seemed concerned, and shares fell nearly 3% in after-hours trading Thursday.

For the fiscal first quarter, Visa posted net income of $4.9 billion, or $2.39 a share, compared with net income of $4.2 billion, or $1.99 a share, in the year-prior period. After adjustments, Visa earned $2.41 a share, beating the FactSet consensus view, which was for $2.34 a share.

Revenue rose to $8.63 billion from $7.94 billion, whereas analysts had been looking for $8.56 billion.

The company saw an 8% boost in payments volume during the latest quarter, while processed transactions rose by 9%.

Consumer spending has been “resilient” and “quite stable,” Suh said.

The company saw a 16% boost in volume from cross-border transactions, which take place when someone makes a purchase from a merchant based in a different country. Cross-border volume typically is seen as a proxy for international travel, though it also encompasses international e-commerce purchases.

“Travel contunues to be a tailwind” and is “quite healthy,” Suh told MarketWatch.

For the fiscal second quarter, Visa expects net revenue to grow at an “upper-mid” to high-single-digit rate. The company also expects earnings per share to grow at a “high-teens” pace from a year before.

The company is sticking with its full-year forecast, which calls for low-double-digit revenue growth on an adjusted constant-dollar basis.

Fiscal 2024 could be “a little bit of a mirror image of 2023 in the sense that our first-half revenue growth rate, even if the fundamentals are very stable…will be compressed just because of the high comparables a year ago, and we see lots of reasons why the second-half-of-the-year growth rates will accelerate,” Suh told MarketWatch.

The company faces easier comparisons in the second half of the year, he said, and management expects to see favorable trends in average ticket sizes.

"Levi Strauss to lay off up to 15% of corporate workforce, stock slides as profit forecast disappoints",economy,"With new leadership coming in after difficult 2023, Levi Strauss & Co. on Thursday announced plans to lay off staff and cut costs over the next few years — part of a multi-year “global productivity initiative” that didn’t do much for the iconic jeans-maker’s share price following a disappointing profit forecast.

Levi Strauss LEVI, +0.19% said it would lay off between 10% and 15% of its global corporate staff in the first half of this year. Executives said they expected the initiative to save $100 million in costs in its fiscal 2024, which ends in November.

The cuts and savings plan came as Chief Executive Chip Bergh prepares to depart from that role and hand the reins to Michelle Gass, who will take over on Jan. 29. Levi’s is also trying to sell more of its own denim directly to shoppers via its own physical stores and online sales network, as outside chain retailers remain cautious on stocking up too much on new clothing following nearly two years of muted demand.

“We have a strong pipeline of newness and innovation launching this year to fuel consumer demand,” Gass said in Levi Strauss’s fourth-quarter earnings release on Thursday. “And I am confident in the significant growth opportunities ahead for this company — including accelerating international growth, becoming a denim-apparel lifestyle business, and leading with” Levi’s direct-to-consumer business.

Still, shares fell 2.5% after hours, after management forecast full-year adjusted per-share profit that was below Wall Street’s expectations.

Levi’s said it expected to earn $1.15 to $1.25 for its full year. That was below FactSet forecasts for $1.33. The company expects full-year sales growth of 1% to 3%.

Levi’s results — and the roadmap it laid out for better profits — follow a host of other companies that have announced job cuts this month, as more companies look to guard their profit margins. Levi’s operating margins in the fourth quarter rose to 9.2% from 8.6% in the same quarter in 2022.

The plans also echoed those that sneaker and athletic gear-maker Nike Inc. announced in December. Nike NKE, +0.01% said it would seek up to $2 billion in cost cuts over the next three years. And it said it was leaning on “newness and innovation” to attract shoppers who, due to higher prices for necessities, haven’t been as eager to spend a lot on new shoes and clothes. One analyst said that strategy wasn’t working.

Levi’s has been hoping its bigger brand-name will help it overcome those difficulties. For the fourth quarter, the company reported sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% year over year. Levi’s reported adjusted earnings per share of 44 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Levi’s to report adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents, on revenue of $1.66 billion.

Its direct-to-consumer sales — or sales from its own stores and e-commerce — jumped 11% in the fourth quarter. Those sales made up a slightly bigger chunk of overall revenue, at 42%, than during the same quarter in 2022.

However, wholesale revenues — or the sales Levi’s gets when retailers buy its clothing and sell it to people shopping in their stores — fell 2%. In that segment, management said “growth of the Levi’s brands in the U.S. and Asia was offset by a decline in Europe.”

Opinion: Intel is struggling to gain traction in AI chips while Nvidia and AMD roar ahead,economy,"It’s a tale of two worlds for Intel INTC, +0.94% these days. At a turbulent time for the silicon industry, the computer-chip giant late Thursday reported that fourth-quarter 2023 revenue rose 10% year over year, with a gross margin increase of 6.5 points. For the 2023 full-year results, however, total revenue was down 14% vs. 2022 and total gross margin slipped to 40% from 42.6%.

Compared to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, +0.03% or even Nvidia NVDA, +0.42% , with 2023 gross margins of 54% and 73% respectively, Intel continues to struggle to find ways to manage costs.

But looking at the overall quarterly or full-year 2023 results doesn’t tell the whole story. Intel’s two most important business units, CCG (client products) and DCAI (data center and AI infrastructure products) could not be on more divergent paths.

The client group at Intel is the cash cow, the part of the company that has continuously provided the revenue and dollars to operate and grow new business units and product lines. Looking at client group operations in last year’s fourth quarter, things look amazing. Revenue was up 33% and operating income jumped more than 450%, with operating income increasing from $500 million to $2.9 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company called out “healthier alignment” to the inventory situation that was the cause for concern over the past couple of years as one of the primary reasons for the turnaround.

This paints 2024 as a potential growth opportunity for client products, inclusive of laptop and desktop CPU chips. Intel launched its new chips, called Core Ultra, for the AI PC market last month, with some systems from partners including Dell and HP available before the holiday, and many more coming this quarter. Intel’s ability to grow its client group earnings is strongly contingent on momentum and consumer excitement over adopting PCs with this new AI capability.

Many industry analysts are calling for a “supercycle” of PC upgrades in the second half of 2024 as more software and interesting consumer use cases move AI computing from the cloud to your local PC. For now, I see AI PC demand as rather soft. Looking at the enthusiast technology audience, one I general consider the leading indicator of technology trends, there is very little interest in “AI for AI’s sake” and instead I see a sense of patience for that “wow” moment to trigger the buying cycle. I’m confident it will happen.

Intel isn’t the only player in this AI PC space. Both AMD AMD, +1.14% and Qualcomm QCOM, +0.06% have very good chips with integrated AI accelerators, and interesting startups like MemryX offer add-on AI chips, so Intel will have to compete on performance and flex its channel-influence muscle to create the best software ecosystem for its parts in order to stand out.

“We are past the point of simply shrugging it off with a ‘better luck next time’ mentality. ”

If this past quarter’s results offer a lot of optimism for the client side of Intel’s house, then they bring an equal amount of questions for the data-center and AI infrastructure business unit. Revenue dropped year over year by 10% and operating income was down 38%, with an operating margin of 2%.

The company commented in a press release that the “CPU addressable market” was contracting and that there were significant competitive pressures on earnings. Yet we are past the point of simply shrugging it off with a “better luck next time” mentality. Intel’s Xeon CPU is still the dominant market-share leader in the data-center CPU chip space, even with the likes of AMD and its Epyc line of parts making inroads. But that clearly isn’t enough to grow the business.

Intel’s data-center group is having issues executing on a plan to capitalize on the AI computing craze. While Nvidia stock skyrockets to a $1.5 trillion valuation, Intel’s data-center GPU products haven’t gained a foothold. And while the Gaudi line of AI accelerators looks good on paper and in the limited benchmarks available, there’s no significant bellwether design wins or partnerships that indicate a flood of sales will be happening anytime soon.

Considering AMD is projecting revenue from its MI300 AI server chip into the billions of dollars for 2024, it’s incredibly concerning that Intel isn’t showing a plan to counter. The company announced a leadership change for this business unit this month, and while a needed move, it is not an instant band-aid to solve the AI issues Intel has.

Read: Missed the boat on AMD’s stock surge? Why this analyst says you’re not too late.

During Intel’s earnings call Q&A, CEO Pat Gelsinger indicated that Intel’s focus for AI in 2024 will be more on AI inference than training, activating and using the AI models rather than creating or building new ones. If the market is moving that way and needs to adopt a slightly different infrastructure base for that to happen, it will lean more to Intel’s strengths.

Additionally, Intel CFO David Zinsner told analysts on Thursday that there is a “$2 billion pipeline” for its “discrete accelerator portfolio” for 2024. This is a positive sign that Intel could still make headway in the data center AI space this year with its Gaudi product. A pipeline is not the same as official revenue projections or a much-needed customer announcement, but it’s a more positive sign than anything that appeared in the company’s earnings statements.

The once vaunted network and edge business unit (NEX) at the company saw revenue drop 24% year over year and operating income drop to a rounding error of zero. And the foundry services business (IFS) increases revenue to $291 million (up 63% year over year) but is still bleeding money as the company spends capital in new facilities and partnerships.

This year is going to be telling for Intel and how it will move forward into the second half the decade. Can this once-unassailable tech giant get back on its feet with Gelsinger’s help and offer both manufacturing and product excellence? Or will it continue to get beaten down by Nvidia, AMD or even Qualcomm — companies that until recently were just flies buzzing around its head?

"U.K. consumers feeling brighter as year starts, with inflation trending down",economy,"U.K. consumers continue to feel cheerier as 2024 starts, according to a survey released Friday.

Research group GfK’s Consumer Confidence Barometer rose three points to minus-19, its highest level in two years. The reading was a little better than the minus-20 expected by economists, according to a poll carried out by the Wall Street Journal.

All components of the barometer rose over the month, including sentiment on the general economic situation ahead, and confidence on making major purchases. Particularly exciting is the measure of respondents’ feelings on their personal financial situation for the coming 12 months, GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said, with the index moving out of negative territory for the first time in two years.

“This significant change is the best single indicator for how the nation’s households feel about their income and expenditure,” Staton said.

“Despite the cost-of-living crisis still impacting many households across the U.K., consumers appear to be encouraged by the positive news about falling inflation,” Staton said. “Let’s see if this optimism continues.”

Consumer prices ticked a little higher in December, though economists expect the rate of inflation to resume its fall in the months ahead.

An increase in household spending would offer a much-needed boost to the U.K. economy as the year begins. Retail sales were weak for much of the latter part of 2023, including the key December period, and economists expect a tough start to 2024 for the wider economy.","['trending', 'rose', 'situation', 'economists', 'consumers', 'starts', 'little', 'months', 'brighter', 'staton', 'uk', 'including', 'inflation', 'feeling', 'households']"
Opinion: Intel stock plunge shows Wall Street still hasn’t learned its lesson on AI hype,economy,"Intel Corp.’s disappointing forecast for the first quarter includes another anticipated double-digit decline in the company’s data-center business, as the chip maker has yet to capitalize on its AI opportunity.

Since its third-quarter earnings, Intel’s stock INTC, +0.94% has surged about 50%, in part due to the potential of providing chips for artificial intelligence. One analyst said in November that Intel represented a potential “under-the-radar AI opportunity.” But on Thursday, its shares tumbled about 11% after hours on its lower-than-expected forecast for the first quarter.

The data center is where Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.42% has been cleaning up with its graphics unit processors (GPUs) designed for AI training and inference applications. Nvidia’s data-center business grew nearly 280% in its fiscal third quarter, as it continues to see nonstop demand for its GPUs to accelerate AI applications.

Intel Chief Financial Officer Dave Zinsner told analysts Thursday, though, that the company has a $2 billion pipeline for its accelerator product line, code-named Gaudi, a chip that is expected to compete with Nvidia. The next iteration, Gaudi 3, is expected to launch sometime in 2024, but CEO Pat Gelsinger did not give any specifics on timing.

“While the data center has seen some wallet-share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio, with well over $2 billion in pipeline, to gain traction as we move through 2024,” Zinsner said Thursday.

Marbel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research, said she believes Intel’s AI story is not going to kick in until the third quarter. “Inferencing is Intel’s strength and where they can win,” she said. “It’s just a longer-term game.”

Some analysts are more skeptical. Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deep Water Asset Management, told CNBC after Intel’s call that he does not believe Intel is going to get the big lift from AI that it is hoping for. “There are better ways to play the AI silicon opportunity,” he said.

Lucas Keh, an analyst at Third Bridge, said in a note to clients that he believed Intel’s new products are coming out at a slower-than-expected pace, and that software is one of the bottlenecks. He said investors were disappointed with a slower-than-expected product ramp.

“It also brings the new question of where exactly cloud players’ appetite are for Nvidia alternatives outside of their own custom silicon developments,” Keh said.

In addition to the data center, Intel also has opportunity in the PC space, where it believes that new, AI-ready PCs with Intel chips that can compute AI queries on the device instead of the cloud, will begin to take off starting in the second quarter and running through the second half of 2024.

But the lesson here is that investors got a bit ahead of themselves on Intel’s AI story, and a reminder that there is still a lot of hope surrounding AI — but not every company has concrete numbers yet.

GM is facing a Justice Department investigation into the gruesome Cruise robotaxi collision that critically injured a pedestrian in San Francisco,others,"General Motors is facing a U.S. Justice Department investigation into a gruesome collision that critically injured a pedestrian and derailed its self-driving car ambitions.

The Justice Department inquiry disclosed in a report Thursday is the latest twist in a debacle that began in October after a robotaxi operated by GM’s Cruise subsidiary dragged a pedestrian about 20 feet (6 meters) after the person was struck in San Francisco by another vehicle driven by a human.

The incident resulted in Cruise’s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership — in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce — as GM curtailed its once-lofty ambitions in self-driving technology. Cruise’s omission of key details about what happened in the Oct. 2 incident also led to allegations of a coverup that could result in a fine of $1.5 million. Cruise has offered to pay $75,000 instead.

GM didn’t release any details about the nature of the Justice Department’s investigation, or of another one by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A company spokesman would only say GM is cooperating with authorities.

The revelations about the latest troubles facing Detroit-based GM and San Francisco-based Cruise came in a report reviewing how things were handled after the pedestrian was hurt.

The report prepared by the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan rebuked Cruise’s management that has since been dumped for “poor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an ‘us versus them’ mentality with regulators.” But the report also asserted that Cruise initially thought it had shown California regulators a video that included segments showing a robotaxi named “Panini” dragging the pedestrian, only to discover later that scene hadn’t been seen because of internet streaming issues.

The report blamed Cruise for having a “myopic focus” on protecting its reputation instead of setting the record straight after management realized regulators hadn’t seen the video of the incident in its entirety.

“Cruise must take decisive steps to address these issues in order to restore trust and credibility,” according to the report’s summary findings.

GM has already installed a new management team at Cruise and walked back its goals for a driverless division that was supposed to transform the transportation industry by operating robotic ride-hailing services across the U.S. Even as skeptics raised doubts about whether autonomous driving technology had become reliable enough to realize that vision, GM was projecting Cruise would generate $1 billion in revenue by 2025 — 10 times the amount it had been bringing in during a ramp-up phase that resulted in billions of dollars in losses.

Cruise had cleared a significant hurdle last August when California regulators approved its request to begin operating its robotaxi service throughout San Francisco at all hours — over the strenuous objections of city officials — only to have it all unravel in early October.","['gruesome', 'facing', 'cruise', 'management', 'justice', 'regulators', 'report', 'pedestrian', 'san', 'investigation', 'incident', 'injured', 'robotaxi', 'francisco', 'gm']"
"4,700 U.S. auto dealers urge President Biden to ‘hit the brakes’ on EPA push on stricter vehicle-pollution standards",environment,"More than 4,700 auto dealerships across the United States urged President Joe Biden in a letter Thursday to halt the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to enforce stricter vehicle-pollution standards.

The missive comes just weeks before the agency’s expected ruling on its tailpipe-emissions proposal, which addresses both climate change and pollutants that are harmful to health.

It is the second letter that auto dealers have sent to the White House in two months on the EPA’s upcoming ruling, which could codify the agency’s strictest-ever tailpipe emissions limits, proposed last April. The dealerships said Thursday that the Biden administration did not respond to their first letter sent on Nov. 28.

An EPA spokesperson said the agency cannot comment as the proposal is currently in the interagency review process.

“President Biden is investing in a future that is made in America by American workers as we position the United States to lead the clean energy future,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “More Americans are buying EVs every day—with EV sales rising faster than traditional gas-powered cars—as the President’s Inflation Reduction Act makes EVs more affordable and helps Americans save money when driving.”

With the world focused on trying to limit warming to no more than 1.5-degree Celsius temperature above pre-industrial times, the administration has an ambitious goal to cut domestic planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. Part of its focus is on the transportation sector, 58% of the emissions from which come from passenger cars and trucks, according to the EPA. The regulation also limits hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the air. These emissions cause a host of health issues and disproportionately affect people who live near heavy traffic.

The EPA says its proposed regulations could mean that up to two out of every three vehicles sold in the U.S. are electric by 2032. That’s higher than the administration’s target of 50% set two years ago.

The regulations, which impact light- and medium-duty vehicles beginning with the 2027 model year, could mean a 56% drop in projected greenhouse gas emissions from the fleet, relative to existing standards, avoiding nearly 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2055. They also reduce pollutants harmful to health by 60% from the existing standard by model year 2032.

Most automakers around the globe have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to transition to all-electric new vehicle sales in the coming decade as momentum to address climate change builds. Last year, U.S. EV sales overall grew 47% to a record 1.2 million, according to Motorintelligence.com. EVs are seeing year-over-year growth, but only hit 7.6% of overall market share in 2023.

Given that, thousands of auto dealers say they won’t be able to meet the EPA’s stringent goals.

Nearly 4,000 dealerships of the nearly 17,000 franchised shops nationwide asked Biden to “tap the brakes” on the EPA proposal in the November letter, referring to the rules as an “electric vehicle mandate.” House Republicans approved a bill in December to block the pollution limits and also called the rules a mandate.

In this week’s letter, the dealerships asked Biden to “hit the brakes” entirely, citing several factors that they say indicate slowing EV adoption. The signers said the supply of EVs on dealer lots is twice that of internal combustion engine vehicles, and that they won’t be able to sell EVs at the rate the regulations would require.

“It is uncontestable that the combination of fewer tax incentives, a woefully inadequate charging infrastructure, and insufficient consumer demand makes the proposed electric vehicle mandate completely unrealistic,” the letter says.

The EPA’s tailpipe-pollution limits wouldn’t require automakers to sell a specific number of EVs every year.

Automakers can meet EPA regulations not just through pure-electric vehicle sales, but also through a sales mix including hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, plus cleaner internal-combustion engine vehicles. The EPA has also said that the auto industry could employ widespread use of particulate filters, which mitigate the soot emitted from conventional gasoline-fueled engines.

“In order to stay on track to meeting overall climate policy goals that have been adopted by the country, I think it’s important to be aggressive in this sector where you have the technology, progress is being made, there’s momentum in markets,” said Jessika Trancik, a professor in energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This can be a really important part of the overall effort to reach 2030 and ultimately, 2050 emissions reduction targets.

“There are a number of different ways you can improve efficiencies and reduce emissions,” Trancik added. But, “If you want to meet those targets, fully electric vehicles are probably going to be a really important tool, at least in part, to allow for that because they do offer the greatest emissions cuts.”

The EPA is also proposing regulations for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and the government’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has separately proposed a fuel-economy increase.","['biden', 'brakes', 'emissions', 'evs', 'vehicle', 'sales', 'hit', 'push', 'stricter', 'regulations', 'president', 'epa', 'letter', 'vehicles', 'vehiclepollution', 'dealers', 'standards', 'urge', 'electric']"
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is meeting the world’s top two producers of memory chips as he reportedly fundraises for his own semiconductor plants,others,"OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman is visiting leaders of South Korea’s semiconductor industry this week, as the artificial-intelligence pioneer weighs an ambitious move into chip production.

Altman, who arrived in Seoul Thursday evening, is touring Samsung Electronics Co.’s chip fabrication plants in Pyeongtaek on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. He’ll meet the top executive of Samsung’s semiconductor business, as well as divisional heads of the foundry, memory and system LSI units, said the person, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. He is also scheduled to meet the CEO of rival SK Hynix Inc. and SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won to discuss ways to collaborate, the person said.

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT more than a year ago, interest in AI applications has skyrocketed, spurring massive demand for the computing power and processors needed to build and run those AI programs. Altman has repeatedly said there already aren’t enough chips for his company’s needs.

It’s not clear what the goals of Altman’s Korea trip are. He has been working to raise billions of dollars to set up a network of factories to manufacture semiconductors, Bloomberg News reported this month. Samsung has been expanding its foundry business, which manufactures chips to the designs of its customers.

Representatives for Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. OpenAI representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

South Korea is a leader in high-end chip production, dominating the market with Taiwan. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the leading foundry in the world, crafting chips for the likes of Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp.

The Korean government this month outlined a blueprint involving investment of 622 trillion won ($466 billion) from the private sector in the years leading up to 2047. They will spend the money to build 13 new chip plants and three research facilities, on top of an existing 21 fabs. Spanning Pyeongtaek to Yongin, the area is expected to be the largest in the world, capable of producing 7.7 million wafers monthly by 2030.

The world’s two biggest memory chipmakers are trying to build their most sophisticated chip plants at home. Samsung is betting big on the foundry expansion as part of a 500 trillion won investment by 2047. SK Hynix aims to invest 122 trillion won in memory in Yongin over the same period.","['plants', 'openai', 'reportedly', 'semiconductor', 'samsung', 'person', 'sam', 'meeting', 'sk', 'won', 'producers', 'memory', 'fundraises', 'worlds', 'foundry', 'trillion', 'chip']"

A global coffee miller has announced plans to shut its operations in Kenya next month as the bungled government-backed reforms in the coffee sector continue to disrupt the industry.

NKG Coffee Mills Kenya, a member of Germany’s Neumann Kaffee Gruppe, says it will lay off staff by the end of February, citing recent regulatory changes in the industry, after the implementation of the Coffee Regulations, 2019 and Capital Markets (Coffee Exchange) Regulations, 2020.

“Following these changes, NKG Coffee Mills Kenya Ltd has not been able to secure the milling license and it is in this regard that the company has taken the decision to close the milling operations. In these ongoing changes, there is a potential/possibility of certain posts within the company’s staff establishment becoming redundant,” the company said.

The letter by the company’s regional head of Human Resources (HR) Hellen Akumu followed a meeting on January 16 by the business to assess its operations and said that there would be consultations to explore alternatives before the February 29 deadline.

The company, which operates across different countries, said it was finalising the plans this month and next.

“The business will set up consultative meetings within the months of January and February 2024. The ideas offered will be given due consideration as we finalise the plans. We shall after this period communicate the final position on the intended redundancy,” Ms Akumu said.

“Whilst exploring alternative avenues during consultations, we wish to notify you of the intended redundancy. If no alternative is found and the redundancy confirmed, as per existing laws, [it] will be effective from February 29, 2024,” the letter stated.

The Hamburg-headquartered NKG has more than 60 companies across the globe.

Kenya coffee is marketed either through the weekly Nairobi Coffee Exchange or sold directly to buyers abroad.

It is not clear the number of workers who will be affected by the looming layoff since the company has not made public details of its employees in Kenya.

Available details, however, show that the company, which has operations in 27 countries, employs 495 people in Africa. Across the 27 countries where it operates, the company employs more than 3,200 people.

In Kenya, the company operates through two subsidiaries, Ibero Kenya Limited, which deals in export and milling, and Tropical Farm Management Kenya, a marketing agent, financer and service provider to farmers.

The exit of the miller and exporter is also set to hit farmers and other workers not directly under its employ but have benefited from its operations across value chains.

President William Ruto in January 2023 signed an executive order tasking his deputy Rigathi Gachagua with spearheading reforms in the coffee and tea sub-sectors.

The campaign has proposed restructurings that include the introduction of a direct settlement system (DSS) aimed at realising expedited and transparent payment of coffee sales proceeds.

The drive is also seeking to push the enactment of the Coffee Bill 2023 that proposes to reorganise the industry by transitioning the regulatory and commercial roles currently undertaken by the Agriculture and Food Authority to the Coffee Board of Kenya.

Further, the legislative proposal also aims at transitioning coffee research currently undertaken by the Coffee Research Institute under the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation to the Coffee Research Institute.

These scheduled reforms have, however, triggered chaos in the sector amid delays in the issuance of marketing and milling permits. This has left millers and marketers without stocks for processing and sale.

Kenya’s coffee is much sought after by roasters and blenders and the international prices are used as a benchmark for the local price at the Nairobi exchange. The sector is, however, limping and requires a revamp as more farmers abandoned the crop for better rewarding ventures such as real estate and avocado farming.

The State is working to curb the slump amid concerns that the once thriving coffee sub-sector has lost its shine, with production declining from 130,000 tonnes to an average 40,000.

Multiple tax incentives and exemptions handed out to the ultra-wealthy and large investors in the past decade are undermining Kenya’s ambition to grow revenues, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.

The IMF, in a new analysis of tax policy and administrative changes in the East African Community countries, says that Kenya’s tax-to-GDP ratio has been on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2014 after the country implemented policies that have ended up narrowing the tax base.

“We are the world. We are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day so let’s start giving”

On January 28, 1985, some of the biggest names in American music gathered at A&M Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles to record a song to support famine relief in Ethiopia. We Are The World became a global anthem using the power of music to turn the world’s attention to the hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa.

The story surrounding that historic recording is revealed in The Greatest Night In Pop, a documentary that premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19 and is available to stream on Netflix from January 29 2024. That date is significant because it marks exactly 39 years to the week the crème de la crème of American music gathered for a marathon recording session. As the 46 stars arrived at the studio straight from attending that night’s American Music Awards, they were greeted with a sign pinned by the record’s producer and conductor Quincy Jones, “please, check your ego at the door”.

Featuring never-before-seen footage, the film reveals the early planning stages of the recording done under United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa), including the writing sessions of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. Some of the artists who were at that historic session including Richie, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson, Cyndi Lauper, Kenny Loggins, Dionne Warwick and Huey Lewis, along with musicians, engineers and production crew reminisce about the events of that night.

Producer Julia Nottingham and director Bao Nguyen who worked together on the 2020 documentary Be Water about legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, reunite for this project that was conceptualised during the pandemic. “My parents were refugees from Vietnam and were music fans, though, and one of the lasting memories I had of childhood was listening to Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie records,” recalls Bao who was no more than 4 years old when We are the World was released. “Those echoes of childhood came back when Julia mentioned the project to me.

Among the director’s first tasks was watching the 1985 documentary We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song hosted by actress Jane Fonda and from that he drew parallels with a heist storyline. “You have all these participants who each have their own superpower, they have this impossible task of assembling this iconic team and recording this song, and they have one night to do it.”

The new film takes a different approach to the earlier documentary by focusing on the run-up to the project, reframing the archive footage and giving the viewer a fly-on-the-wall peep into the scenes in the recording studio. The singers themselves admit their own anxieties, from the trembling knees of Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper concerned about her jewellery leaking into the microphone and Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan both nervous about their solos.

Lionel Richie who cannot conceal his emotions through most scenes in the film provides the crucial link to the events surrounding the making of the song. “He is one of the most impressive, humble, hardworking stars I have come across,” says Julia Nottingham.

“From an editorial perspective, he is diligent, he’s thorough. He’s just amazing. He challenged us in the best ways and always wanted the best for it. He brought his best self to every moment in it.”

Although some of the videotapes were in poor condition and others were lost, an unlikely source came to the rescue. Journalist David Breskin who wrote an article for Life magazine about the project had kept his Dictaphone recording from the moment he was assigned the story, a few weeks prior to the recording, including in the studio.

Some of that audio was painstakingly synced to footage that had lost its audio. “No one has ever heard Michael and Lionel write that song,” says Julia “In the world of making archive films, these are gifts that you pray for, and when they arrive, you just thank your lucky star.”

We are the World was officially released on March 7 1985, and in another milestone, over 8,000 radio stations around the world played the song simultaneously on April 5, 1995. The record sold more than 20 million copies and won three Grammy Awards in 1986, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year, and raised more than $60 million for charity.

“Considering the chaos that happened, considering the confusion that was there, on top of the egos, we are doing the video, we are doing the vocals, we are doing the background singers, we are doing the still shots for the cover of Life magazine, in 7 hours?” Quipped Lionel Richie during the premiere of The Greatest Night In Pop at the Sundance Film Festival last weekend. “It is impossible! It worked.”

Are some local banks over-risking in the Eurodollar market?,economy,"Columnists Are some local banks over-risking in the Eurodollar market?

The magnitude of their exposure to dollar-denominated instruments is a real concern in the current environment. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK

On Tuesday, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) quoted the shilling at 161.35 against the US dollar, a sharp drop from the 156.46 exchange rate at the end of December last year.

While some of the factors (both external and internal) behind this depreciation are well known, one gets a bad rap: the Eurodollar market - a misleading term referring to US dollars deposited in banks outside the United States and which are not subject to US banking regulations.

Are (some) players stockpiling dollars in anticipation that the local unit would lose further ground against the greenback and other major world currencies? I believe so.

The latest data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows foreign currency deposits increasing at a faster pace than before. Total deposits reached Sh1.2 trillion at the end of June 2023, up 32 percent from Sh 891.5 billion as of June 2022.

Specifically, corporate bodies accumulated slightly over Sh800 billion in absolute foreign currency deposits by mid-last year compared to Sh592 Billion in the year prior. Similarly, household foreign currency deposits climbed by 26 percent to stand at Sh373 billion as at the end of June 2023 compared to a year prior.

Now, we can assume that, since corporations account for about 70 percent of the dollar deposits, these holdings are purely for international trade reasons. While that may be true, it's highly probable some players see the market as a window to long the dollar as a way to hedge against the fast-depreciating shilling.

Furthermore, with Eurodollar deposits offering attractive rates over domestic deposit rates, the trade is a no-brainer - fueling this rate premium is the fact that the Eurodollar market operates with minimal regulatory constraints, which in theory, should allow for higher deposit rates.

That said, concerns are being raised over the expanding short-term forex maturities within the banking system. Rising Eurodollars deposits, sourced as term deposits maturing at near terms (weeks to several months), although deemed low risk, pose a huge risk with the key question being: in a prolonged dollar-shortage scenario, where will banks get dollars to fill the dollar-funding gap?

Typically, these gaps should be funded by interbank forex loans, borrowing from central banks, currency swaps, etc. However, all these markets are in a tight bind because of risk and liquidity concerns. So, in a doomsday scenario, if a particularly important bank or series of banks in the Eurodollar market were to default, this could trigger damaging bank runs.

Even if a bank is sufficiently capitalised, large Eurodollar obligations are likely to undermine liquidity. Given these risks, the rapid growth of the Eurodollar market should not go unnoticed.

Although it provides an alternate channel of financing for banks to load up their balance sheets with Eurodollar liabilities, the potentially dire consequences with respect to dollar funding gaps is a major concern and needs to be monitored.

The magnitude of their exposure to dollar-denominated instruments is a real concern in the current environment.

Jaboya: Radical wisdom emerges from the fish for sex trade,others,"Arts Jaboya: Radical wisdom emerges from the fish for sex trade

Millaz Players cast on stage at the Kenya National Theatre. PHOTO | POOL

Jaboya is Dhuluo, meaning “fish for sex” and it’s a form of gendered trade that is commonly used to describe what happens every day when the fisherman at Lake Victoria come back to land and find scores of women waiting to sell themselves for fish.

“It’s a function of poverty and lack of choices,” the BD Life is told by Kathy Tate-Bradish, an HIV educator who works in Western Kenya. “It’s the major factor resulting in the counties along the lake having the highest prevalence of HIV in Kenya,” she adds.

To best understand the meaning of Jaboya, one needed to be at Kenya National Theatre recently to watch Millaz Players’ performance of Jaboya. Scripted by Emmanuel Chindia, the play captured the vibrant, sensual energy that swells the shore every time men come in with their catch of the day. That’s when women scramble to be first in line since the transactions involve both money and fish for sex freely exchanged.

Read: Two contrasting views of town and country

We meet a stew of quibbling female fishmongers, all competing for access to the men with the most fish. For a Big Fish boss like Odongo (Sultan Mbimwa), he can have sex with no less than five women a night as we see while he argues with Otieno (Samuel Baraza) over the boat he’d promised him.

It’s the Chief (Gaitan Brian) who suggests to the women that they need to stop quibbling among themselves and organise to buy a boat of their own. His radical suggestion is antithetical to the traditional taboo related to women never becoming fisher(wo)men. Now we’re getting into thorny territory since the Chief's idea essentially calls on women to challenge patriarchal (man-made) taboos.

“There’s no reason women can’t be fishermen,” Chief says, sounding like a true feminist, not a government emissary spewing the conventional patriarchal party line. It takes some time for the women to hear what he’s saying and appreciate his radical wisdom. Eventually, they start believing that owning a boat of their own makes a lot of sense.

But then, they have another problem which is trusting one another and identifying one honest leader among them who they can all believe in. But once they do, they set up their own chama or economic merry-go-round to raise the cash required to buy the boat.

As it turns out, they can almost raise the funds required, but for Sh50. That money comes from Kamum (Faith Wambui), the young schoolgirl who won a cash prize for her high marks. But she understood the implications of the women being liberated financially. Yet by her making that sacrifice, she is left with insufficient funds for school fees. It's pathetic to see how she’s left stranded at home. Her only hope lies with the women buying the boat, something they are prepared to do as the story ends.

Unfortunately, women cannot end all the outmoded taboos in a single act of revolutionary courage. One that remains involves Beryl’s family which has a timeline on sex. All sex is outlawed within Her family’s timeframe of a 10-week period.

Tragically, Opiyo (Mike Ndaka) ignored that taboo and sleeps with Beryl (Mary Mutabe). And for that, he dies, illustrating just how deeply entrenched certain cultural beliefs still are in Luo and other African cultures generally.

No one except Odongo feels the pain at Opiyo’s demise since they’d been bosom buddies forever. The issue at hand is the programme of the women. They’d been basically sex workers as well as fishmongers before. But now they're on a quest to obtain their economic freedom since they would all own the boat and all share the spoils of fishing for their own food and their own fish business.

I hope Millaz takes Jaboya to Nyanza region and to the Lake where they could invite women to see the show since it could introduce them to a few revolutionary ideas that might have a positive impact on their lives.

Jaboya is an impressive production directed by Mike Ndeda, assisted by Faiz Ouma. The show’s choreographer did such a good job that the movements of the characters flowed naturally from the script’s action. The scriptwriter, Chindia did well to assemble so many important themes, keeping them flowing organically until he found a logical way for the women to rise above their oppressive circumstances and find a viable solution that could be a real possibility.

All power to the women! And to Millaz.

Kenya's healthcare presents a paradox. There is a steady exodus for specialised treatments abroad, at the same time there is an influx of patients seeking Kenya's specialised skills from the region.

A total of 569 patients were sent abroad for specialised care between 2021 and 2022, with India accounting for most of these referrals. In particular, 462 referrals or four out of every five patients, went to India, accounting for an outstanding 81.2 percent. Singapore, South Africa, and Israel are other markets where Kenyans sought specialised treatment.

The most common treatment sought abroad was open heart surgery (71 patients), followed by stem cell replacements (44) and bone marrow transplants (29). Other notable treatments were kidney transplants (11), liver transplants (21), radiotherapy (26), and arterial switch operations (20). Notably, 19 patients sought medical evaluation for wellness, diagnosis and alternative treatment options, and 17 travelled for chemotherapy.

The wide range of treatments sought highlights the equally diverse needs of people travelling abroad for medical care. Reasons advanced for India as a preferred destination for medical referrals include its perceived professional medical care at more affordable prices when compared to other markets.

While Kenyans seek advanced treatments overseas, Kenya paradoxically enjoys a strong reputation among its East African neighbours, attracting referrals from Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, and Ethiopia. Additionally, its expertise draws patients from further afield, with referrals from Nigeria and even the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the Ministry of Health, Kenya gets 3,000 to 5,000 medical tourists from other African countries.

Patients from these countries sought specialised treatment from both public and private hospitals. The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), for example, received 250 patients from neighbouring countries seeking specialised treatment. Many others were treated in various public and private health facilities.

This demonstrates that Kenya can position itself as a leading regional medical tourism destination in East Africa and beyond, attracting patients from around the world and stimulating growth across multiple sectors. In addition to helping the healthcare sector, the ensuing economic growth would empower communities, generate new employment opportunities, and advance Kenya's overall development.

The private sector will also play a key role in investing in advancing medical tourism in the country.

As we navigate through 2024, let us accelerate plans for a thriving medical tourism market in Kenya. If successful, a thriving medical tourism market would uplift lives and livelihoods.

Yony Waite: Activist artist who opened up space for indigenous Africans,others,"Visual Arts Yony Waite: Activist artist who opened up space for indigenous Africans

Yony Waite is one of the most important environmental and visual artists of Kenya, East Africa, and beyond the borders of the mind as well as geography. In fact, Yony ‘emerged’ as a citizen of the world long before she came to Kenya. Her passing on will touch the hearts of many who loved and admired her as an artist and activist for the planet.

She was born in Hollywood, raised on the island of Guam, and trained artistically both at the University of California, Berkeley, and Japan where she apprenticed under sagacious Master painters. By the time she arrived in Kenya after spending time in Somalia with family, she was already a practising professional artist. She initially came as a tourist. But then, I think she was grabbed by the land, the wildlife, and the ocean.

She was briefly married to David Hopcraft and lived on the family ranch at Athi River. Fortunately, a family settlement enabled her to stay at the ranch even after the couple split up. The ranch became a home base for her when she wasn’t staying in Lamu where she established her second home, an old four-story Swahili house, not far from the Lamu Museum.

Lamu is also where she set up her Wildebeeste Workshop, held exhibitions and ran trainings in print-making on her old printing press. She also designed projects with Lamu women groups. “I would work with her and the women when I went to see her,” Yony’s sister-in-law, Linda Benvenuto told the BD Life. “Together they’d produce wonderful wall hangings that Yony would sell and bring the revenue back to the women,” Linda explains.

But Yony would never remain in one place for long. She was always on the move, always a hippie at heart from the sixties. She, like so many of her generation, was inspired by Jack Kerouac’s novel, On the Road which was all about a band of buddies who traversed the US, celebrating their freedom with jazz, poetry, and ‘mind-expanding’ substances.

But to travel, Yony needed funds, not just to travel, but to open up spaces to exhibit her art. At the time, there were few galleries. So in 1969, she and the British artist, Robin Anderson and designer David Hart started Gallery Watatu.

“I never intended to run a business [at Watatu],” Yony said in words captured during her exhibition opening with Theresa Musoke and Tabitha wa Thuku at Circle Art Gallery several years back.

Linda Benvenuto, Yony's sister-in-law, next to Yony's 6ft tall four-panelled screen in Karen, Nairobi, on January 22, 2024. PHOTO | MARGARETTA WA GACHERU | NMG

She could have been talking about why she was happy to sell Watatu to Ruth Schaffner in 1985. The other two Watatu founders had left long before, and Yony didn’t want the responsibility, so she was happy to hand over her gallery as long as she could have a permanent foothold for her art at the space.

But years before she left Watatu to Ruth, Yony was advocating for indigenous Africans to exhibit at Watatu. The ones that did included everyone from Ancent Soi and Jak Katarikawe to Etale Sukuro and Theresa Musoke.

But apart from her roles as founder of two art galleries and artist producing paintings that project some of the most enchanting semi-abstract portraits of animals in the wild, Yony will be remembered for her passionate positions on war, peace, and the power brokers who benefit off of war at the expense of innocent civilians’ lives.

For instance, Yony felt so strongly about the American invasion of Iraq that she sacrificed her identity as an American citizen in protest against the Iraq war. She subsequently became a Kenyan citizen.

Up to the end, Yony refused to ‘die gracefully’. Instead, she was ‘on the road’, still afflicted with her third bout of pneumonia, and still insisting on flying to Lamu to tie up some loose ends. She then took buses to reach Mombasa, where she went to hospital but then got on a train back to Nairobi where she went straight to Nairobi Hospital. And when she was reminded that she had no will but had said she wanted to leave something to her workers, Linda says, “She wrote on the back page of the book she was rereading,” It turns out, the book was Kerouac’s On the Road!

Yony passed on January 13, 2024, a day we’ll commemorate from now on. Her spirit is immoral so, as much as we grieve her demise, we celebrate the beauty, light, wisdom, and joy she brought to us in her art and in her life.

A small collection of Yony’s paintings will be at One Off Gallery from January 27, 2024.

Last year's COP28 climate forum was a fair arbitration between oil industry and competing renewable energy sectors. My understanding of the consensus is that the oil industry and renewables sectors will continue to invest within a managed energy transition, with government policies steering national and regional energy markets towards reduced carbon emissions and globally agreed climate targets while paying due attention to energy security.

Essentially, this opens up access to global funding for both oil and renewable energy sectors without recrimination, a situation that reduces activism in energy investments. And for energy economists, it will be a nightmare estimating future national and global oil demands which will additionally be impacted by the rate of renewable energy technology investments and uptake, besides the usual macroeconomics. Uncertainties or inaccuracies in global oil demand estimation can lead to oil price instability, with a negative influence on oil production investments.

Currently, the most imminent threat to oil demands across the world is the rate of electric vehicles (EVs) uptake. Unlike 10 years ago when EV technologies were nascent and experiencing doubts about their scalability, today EV unit costs continue to reduce, with mass uptake increasing especially in China, Europe, and the USA.

These countries are facilitating major production capacity expansion. At the current level of investments and research, EVs are expected to dominate the roads in 10 years.

In Kenya, we need to correctly estimate the pace of energy transition to allow the country to correctly plan its future petroleum and renewable infrastructure. Kenya, being mostly a second-hand vehicle market, will experience about a five-year lag relative to global EV uptake.

However, eventually internal combustion engine vehicles will give way to electric vehicles, a fact we need to consider when planning for petroleum and EV infrastructure.

Other areas of our energy markets that will be impacted by the energy transition are the potential replacement of fuel oil in thermal power generation and heavy industries, and the solarisation of diverse equipment that traditionally use petroleum products.

In respect of Turkana oil, we still have a window of about 15 years to monetise the oil resources to earn or save foreign exchange by exporting or reducing oil imports. How and when to include Turkana oil in Kenya’s economic and energy matrix is screaming for action. Countries around the world are having to contend with how to maximise the value from their oil resources before global oil demands diminish.

The government is seeking to build an additional 30 county aggregation and industrial parks for value addition to boost exports, even as it targets to double foreign direct investments to Sh1.6 billion this year.

Trade and Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano said the establishment of the aggregation hubs would boost value-addition across value chains and spur manufacturing productivity.

The government had initially targeted 18 County Aggregation and Industrial Parks whose construction has begun. The addition means some 48 industrial parks will now be built under the programme.

“This growth strategy includes the establishment of 30 additional County Aggregation and Industrial Parks, stimulating the activation of priority value chains across the country,” Ms Miano said.

The CAIPs are special zones being set up in all 47 counties by FY 2025/26.

The facilities will provide value-addition centres for agricultural products as well as storage facilities.

The ministry targets to grow the contribution of Kenya’s manufacturing sector to the gross domestic product from 7.6 percent to 10 percent in 2024, with a long-term aim of 20 percent by 2030.

Ms Miano spoke during a meeting with heads of State corporations, agencies and departments within the ministry, where she laid down the strategic objectives for the current year and over the coming years.

“I would like to reiterate our ministry’s commitment to support the bottom-up economic transformation agenda and what we shall be presenting at the Cabinet retreat. Number one, we will be doubling exports to GDP from the current 10 percent, by 2027. Secondly is to double FDIs in 2024 from the current $800 million to $1.6 billion by the close of 2024,” she said.

Kenya Bureau of Standards managing director Esther Ngari said the agency continued to certify products small businesses produce, supporting their operations.

“Under operational efficiency. We achieved a remarkable 114 percent in certified products for micro, small and medium enterprises, helping them grow, and 59.2 percent increase of large firms which were certified reflecting successful operation efficiency enhancement,” she said.

At the same time, Industrialization Principal Secretary Juma Mukhwana said the ministry’s target was to wean as many agencies off exchequer support, by having them raise funds from operations.

“If you're buying raw materials and then you make a product and you sell it in the market, why do you want us to give you money?” the PS posed.

The High Court has endorsed a 2021 government policy centralising the procurement of leased motor vehicles by public bodies at the Treasury.

Dismissing a petition by Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah, High Court judge Lawrence Mugambi said the circular issued on June 26, 2021, was an amplification of what was already in law and policy (consortium procurement).

The judge said there was no need for public participation before the circular was issued by the Head of Public Service directing ministries, departments and agencies running leasing programmes to immediately register them with the Treasury to be managed centrally.

Also read: Omtatah sues to block MPs Sh4.4bn cover

“Central leasing is already incorporated in the Procurement and Asset Disposal Act 2015 and is described as consortium buying, a scheme where procurement entities can come together and procure jointly to benefit from economies of scale,” said the judge.

Justice Mugambi added that all that the circular did was to give guidance concerning that particular procurement item, but the rules did not change.

“It was not against the existing legal provisions nor was it usurpation of the roles of respective accounting officers. It did not contravene the existing statutory provisions. In my view, the circular was executive in nature and meant to guide the application of the prevailing policy,” the judge said, adding that the circular could thus not be considered a statutory instrument as argued by Mr Omtatah.

The senator had argued that policy centralising the leasing and procurement of leased motor vehicles by public bodies was invalid, as there was no public participation.

He added that the circular was made in bad faith and in contravention of the constitutional precepts of transparency, competitiveness and cost-effectiveness.

According to Mr Omtatah, the Head of Public Service has no capacity in law to unilaterally centralise the leasing programme.

It was his argument that the move would allow Treasury CS to usurp the responsibilities of specific procurement offices in the ministries, yet they have their own internal procurement systems.

The Attorney General defended the decision arguing that the government made the move to achieve value for money and that the allegation of usurping the role of accounting officers was unfounded and baseless.

The court heard that the argument by Mr Omtatah only aimed at trivializing the role of government in safeguarding public resources.

If you still receive the paper electricity bill, try tracking movements in the category ‘forex adjustment cost’ to appreciate the gravity of the suffering of the consumer as the Kenya shilling falls.

The depreciation of our currency hits the consumer in two ways. First, what is known in jargon as realised forex losses.

These are the losses that Kenya Power suffers when they have made foreign currency payments for actual foreign currency-denominated obligations such as power purchase costs, loans and interest on government-guaranteed foreign loans, and fuel from power plants using imported oil.

These costs are passed on to the consumer through the monthly forex adjustment costs using the Central Bank of Kenya's mean exchange rate.

Secondly, the unrealised forex losses. These are not recovered from the customer until the actual payments are made. They refer to book losses that Kenya Power suffers when it has to restate its loans and other liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in Kenya shillings, the reporting currency of its financial statements.

I hold the view that our future, in terms of both affordable prices and security of supply, will depend on the investments we make in locally produced power, including in coal and gas.

Where our energy sector is today, we cannot afford to be carried away by the climate change hysteria and postpone our plans for gas and coal.

Why is it that we no longer talk too loudly about the large coal deposits we discovered a long time ago in Kitui? Why do I get the impression that plans to import natural gas from Tanzania are on the back burner?

If you closely followed the politics of COP28, the subliminal message was that countries like China, Brazil and India are not prepared to sacrifice their economic health at the altar of the climate change cause.

This is how an Indian diplomat put it: ""We must have the right to dig coal just as the United States has a right to frack for gas"". He argued that Western countries that have taken their carbon space are leaving little space for countries from the developing world.

Expensive fuel

Thus, Kenya and Tanzania will not be out of place if they insist on pressing their right to produce natural gas and to convert some of the plants that use expensive imported fuel into using natural gas.

COP28 was happening against a backdrop of serious and urgent plans by Kenya to build a natural gas pipeline to run from Dar es Salaam to Mombasa.

This project will by far be the most significant game-changer in the efforts by the two countries to deliver cheap electricity to its citizens.

Already, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) had identified a suitable location for the building of both an LNG terminal and an LNG power plant in the Dongo Kundu, Mombasa.

Several years ago, Kenya — in anticipation of the proposed LNG pipeline from Dar es Salaam to Mombasa — came up with laws and regulations that oblige fuel power stations to convert from expensive fuel to cheaper natural gas as soon as the natural gas is available and is within reach.

The project will change the landscape and maths of power generation because, within the Mombasa region alone, Kenya has five power stations that will be obliged to do a fuel-for-natural gas swap when the Dar to Mombasa pipeline is completed.

Natural gas

The power plants which will have to implement fuel for natural swaps include Kipevu 1 with an installed capacity of 75MW, Kipevu 2 (74.5 MW) Kipevu GT (60MW), Rabai (90MW) and Kipevu 3 (120 MW).

The benefits from conversion to natural gas will be huge because based on current electricity prices, the estimates are that Kenya will experience an annual saving of Sh10 billion per year to electricity consumers.

With the public transport being the biggest cause of distributed air pollution, the conversion to gas will contribute to improved air quality.

The benefits to Tanzania will also be huge. The current estimates are that the country will earn $324 million in natural gas sales and a further $162 million in wheeling charges.

With the pipeline construction costs estimated at $700 million, the project constitutes one of the largest FDI inflows into Tanzania in recent years.

East Africa must resist the temptation of blindly joining the green lobby power by leaving their oil, gas, and coal in the ground in exchange of pledges for climate financing from the West.

My daughter wore a very small black dress for her birthday dinner. I have a history with it. I bought it when I travelled to New York. I was guided by a photo and specific instructions from her. Unable to find it in stores, I eventually found it on Amazon, which dropped it off at a drop-off point in Long Island where I was staying, and spent an hour at night looking for the drop-off point.

She looked devastating in it. She wanted to see the gardens at Talisman and as we made our way through the restaurant, men stared at her. I wanted to shout at them, “She is only 16!” The whole night, I sat there feeling a mix of feelings; pride and fear.

Proud that she was turning into a resourceful, respectable, and self-aware woman. Fearful that now she would meet all sorts of men, some terrible, and that she would hurt at times. Fearful that she would leave me in two years to chase her dreams and build her community as I grow old and arthritic and not be able to chew my food.

Our waiter was very kind to us and very attentive to her. Made her feel special. We both had the Chicken Al Limone and creamy mash, which was one of the best meals I’d had in a while. She ordered a mocktail to make her feel sophisticated and ladylike. My son, who barely talked to us because he insisted on bringing his goddamn tablet for dinner, had something fishy.

In the end, they brought out her cake from the kitchen under the hullabaloo of song and dance that she had warned me against. She turned and stared at me murderously and lovingly. I hate song and dance too but come on, it’s sweet 16! I wanted to make her 16th night memorable. I - egotistically, as a father should - wanted none of her boyfriends to match this night but also to give her a decent benchmark for them to do.

What a beautifully heartbreaking night at Talisman it was. Felt like we were all crossing the Rubicon.

Nairobi collects more revenue than 30 counties combined,others,"Economy Nairobi collects more revenue than 30 counties combined

Nairobi County continues to dominate its peers in revenue generation, collecting 22 percent of the own revenues reported by all the devolved government units in the last financial year.

Nairobi collected Sh8.16 billion compared to Sh36.8 billion generated by all 47 counties, according to a report by the National Treasury on financial statements in the 2022/23 fiscal year.

The report exposes disparities in own revenue collections with the 30 lowest performing counties contributing to only about a fifth (21 percent) of the total revenues.

This points to the concentration of economic opportunities in the capital and its surroundings, leaving much of the expansive country with little to contribute to the economy.

In 2021/22, Nairobi collected Sh7.6 billion, which was more than the combined collection of 32 counties that generated Sh7.5 billion.

In 2022/23, the 30 lowest performers collected between Sh46.8 million and Sh593.8 million.

They include Wajir (Sh46.8 million), Tana River (Sh59 million), Garissa (Sh82 million), Isiolo (Sh91 million), Nyamira (Sh97 million), Mandera (Sh123 million), Vihiga (Sh127 million), West Pokot (Sh128 million) and Marsabit (Sh142 million).

Embu (Sh593.8 million), Kirinyaga (Sh552 million), Nyandarua (Sh491 million), Homa Bay (Sh491 million), Kericho (Sh477 million) and Nandi (Sh199 million), are also listed among counties whose combined collection was surpassed by Nairobi.

Read: Only four counties meet own-source revenue target

Nandi, however, disputes its reported collection, saying the figure captured by the Treasury, and the Controller of Budget (COB) was not representative of all the own revenues during the year.

“Analysis of the report indicated this was actually underscored because some lines of revenues were not included. These include Sh171,354,269 being funds collected and spent under the Facility Improvement Fund Act, 2019. Similarly, another Sh12,047,051 was not reported. These, summed up, takes us to Sh381,701,320,” said Nandi County Executive Committee Member for Finance, Hillary Serem.

“We have since raised the same with the CoB who encouraged us to ensure self-reporting is always done accurately and timely,” he added.

Analysis of the own revenues performance shows that collections for 10 counties dropped, compared to their collections during the previous financial year.

Nakuru’s reported the highest drop of 50 percent to Sh1.6 billion, compared to the Sh3.3 billion it collected in 2021/22. Nakuru governor Susan Kihika did not respond to our questions on factors that could have affected the revenue performance, and strategies to boost the same in the current financial year and moving forward.

Nakuru was followed by Kisumu and Nyamira whose collections dropped by 42 percent each, to Sh695 million and Sh97 million respectively.

On the other hand, counties with the biggest improvement in own revenue collections were Narok, which more than doubled from Sh1.2 billion to Sh2.9 billion and Samburu, which increased from Sh112 million to Sh226 million.

Kiambu collected nearly Sh1 billion more, increasing from Sh2.7 billion in 2021/22 to Sh3.6 billion.

“We improved because we are running a government where commitment and integrity is a must. But even if there was an improvement throughout the period, this is hardly a number we can applaud given that it was during election season and there were transitional impacts,” said Kiambu governor, Kimani Wamatangi.

The governor, however, noted that even with the improvement, the county lost 30 percent of its own revenues to corruption activities within its workforce, noting that actual collections could have surpassed Sh5 billion. He said the outlook for the year ending June 2024 is for the county to collect Sh7.9 billion, which will be more than a third of its Sh22 billion budget.

Read: Nairobi own source revenue grows 17pc

With the Sh3.6 billion collections, Kiambu was the second after Nairobi, but it was still less than half what Nairobi recorded.

In total, seven counties collected more than Sh1 billion each from their own sources in 2022/23, down by one (Kisumu) from the performance in 2021/22.

Directline Assurance shocks PSVs with cashless fares,economy,"Companies Directline Assurance shocks PSVs with cashless fares

All public service vehicles (PSVs) insured by Directline Assurance will have to switch to cashless fare platforms, including M-Pesa, as the insurer moves to curb fraudulent claims coming from passenger injuries and deaths.

Directline, which has the largest share of the PSVs insurance business, has issued a circular to all operators of matatus it has insured to make the shift effective February 1, in a move that also offers a revenue boost for banks and telcos that support cashless payments.

The insurer says it has developed a passenger manifest system for verifying third-party claims. The manifest will offer evidence that people making claims related to injuries or death were indeed in the vehicles involved in the accident.

Read: Directline doubles profit to Sh252m

“All public service vehicles to be insured by the company will be required to register with a cashless passenger manifest system. The company will provide the technology for the consolidation of the same. This will be put in operation through digital fare payment,” said Directline in a circular issued on Wednesday.

“To this effect, from February 1, 2024, the company will only issue policies to PSVs with a registered digital payment method from any of the payment gateways, for example, M-Pesa till available in the country.”

Direcline closed last June with Sh1.66 billion gross premiums from motor commercial PSV covers, giving it a 60.79 percent market share in this class of business, according to the Insurance Regulatory Authority data.

It was followed at a distance by Xplico (9.7 percent), Africa Merchant Assurance (9.26 percent), Invesco (9.01 percent), and GA Insurance (6.94 percent). Only 10 insurers in Kenya currently underwrite commercial buses and matatus.

Directline suffered Sh576.22 million underwriting losses in insuring matatus and buses in the six months ended June 2023, exceeding the Sh311.88 million loss in the full year ended December 2022.

The insurer’s move means passengers who make cash payments in buses and matatus may struggle to get compensation in case of an accident since Directline will only recognise those passengers captured in the digital manifest.

“The company requires PSV policyholders to implement a digital passenger manifest for verification of claimants after the occurrence of accidents.

This will enhance the process of injury claims management as well as adequately respond to the timelines being applied in the small claims court,” said Direcline.

An earlier cashless fare payment platform fronted by the government, launched in November 2014, flopped following opposition from matatu operators who felt that it was a ploy to monitor their daily earnings for taxation measures. The digital payment system required passengers to get pre-paid cards or use mobile money for payment of fares in PSVs.

Read: Directline takes 77 percent of matatu insurance

The motor insurance business has generally been a loss-making business for insurers over the years.

Many insurers have been aggressive in revising premiums upwards to reflect the level of risk in the market and also dropping comprehensive covers for some models of vehicles deemed too risky.

There have also been insurers adopting telematics—in-car monitoring devices— to adjust premium rates based on policyholders' mileage and driving habits.

Nivi Sharma: Leading in the shadow of greatness,others,"Profiles Nivi Sharma: Leading in the shadow of greatness

Before Nivi Sharma dives into what she does, she first makes this writer eggs with feta cheese and assorted condiments, throws in some spices in a pot, and roasts them before turning water into masala tea. She’s a great cook, but she isn’t as good as her husband, who, she insists, is an excellent cook, a biker, a camper, a man who faces all sunsets. But more of him later.

Now cupping a mug of coffee in her hands, Nivi talks about her tech journey as chief operating officer at BRCK, a tech startup that provided free public Wi-fi, and her innovation of KioKit, an award-winning digital education toolkit. In 2011, she co-founded eLimu, the first company to digitise the Kenyan Primary school curriculum content (later acquired by iHub in 2020).

Then her mother died, and as she scattered half of her ashes over the Ganges River at Rishikesh Bridge in Haridwar, India, she got answers that led her to take on the CEO role at Bridges to Prosperity, a global leader in rural infrastructure. The organisation has built 508 bridges in 21 countries, giving 1.8 million people access.

She serves on Standard Chartered Bank Kenya and The Open Institute boards. When she isn’t cooking or camping with her daughter, husband, and two sausage dogs called Bonanza and Jelly Bean, names she considered naming her daughter had her husband not put the kibosh on that. “Thank God, because he said, ‘No, Nivi, you name the dogs, I will name the child.’”

How did you end up building bridges in rural areas?

A property developer called Ken Frantz from Virginia, US, makes a big killing in a sale and, like a good American, buys himself a new Ford truck. As he sits in the waiting room at the Ford service station, he opens up a copy of a National Geographic magazine. He sees a photo of this broken bridge in Ethiopia, a very historical bridge. It’s called the Sebara Dildy, the Fasil bridge. It is a 17th-century bridge built over the Abbay River. Knowing what he knows about civil engineering and construction, he says, “I can go and build that bridge”.

And so he did and found his calling on that bridge. After that, he went around the world, from South America to Asia, looking for communities that showed a clear need to get from point A to point B and built a few bridges a year.

The turning point for Bridges to Prosperity was established by a young lady - Avery Bang - who came in as a university volunteer. This vision of solving a problem guided her; one in seven people in the world doesn’t always have access, and the amount of infrastructure dollars spent on rural infrastructure is shockingly low, especially given that 80 percent of the poor live in rural areas. Bridges are important in these areas because they help farmers make better decisions about the kind of crops to grow and farm inputs to buy - knowing that a bridge will always be there. This translates to a 75 percent increase in farmer profits and a 30 percent boost in their household income. I love to solve such problems, important problems that touch on humanity.

Was your childhood interesting?

It was a beautiful childhood. I’m grateful to my parents, who raised me to be grateful. They came here as immigrants with few [possessions], but they knew how to cultivate the networks to be entrepreneurs and business people and joy. They loved each other deeply. One of the greatest gifts they gave me, and if I may say, one of the most important things we can teach our children is how to make a happy life for themselves.

When we look around us, at our friendships and work, do we see what’s good about it? That’s the essence of cultivating joy. When dark times come, we should be able to recognise that as the shadow of greatness, right? That has guided me in my professional journey. I can say, yeah, of course, this person isn’t great at filling out spreadsheets and reports, but if I send him to a sales meeting or a meeting with a government official, he will leave with a different heart.

What are your earliest memories of your childhood?

Being sent home from school because my parents had not paid my school fees. My mom and dad fought about that because my dad gave away my school fees to help someone who lacked. [Chuckles]

What kind of a man was your dad?

Oh, let me tell you about my mom first. She came from a community of Indians called the Siddhis, known to be astute businesspeople and very good with numbers. They’ve amassed wealth in the Indian diaspora community. On the other hand, my father comes from the Bengalis, a community known for winning Oscars and Pulitzer prizes and writing novels. The Bengalis are very poetic. They compose beautiful songs and literature. Both of my parents refused to live their lives according to the community’s expectations.

Despite their differences, they made a beautiful couple. They loved each other profoundly and balanced each other well. My mom was always thinking about what came next, making plans. She was ambitious. My father always had a joke, a smile, and kindness to share with anyone around him. He was terrible with money. (Chuckles). My dad still walks with a bunch of Sh50 notes that he gives to anyone he thinks the money might bring a smile to their face.

Sometimes, I look at him and think he is just a man looking for external validation. Other times, I see the genuine joy he gets from making other people happy, however big or small that may be. That’s quite an infectious and, sometimes, irritating thing to be around.

Quite the couple, your parents.

Yes. It was my mom’s fourth anniversary on Tuesday. I was raised in the shadow of a great woman. She was brilliant. Being human, she made some horrible mistakes, as we all do in our lives, but she told me to always be present in moments. Like everyone, I’ve been embarrassed by my parents. I have laughed at my parents. I would not always get presents on my birthdays, but she would write me a card filled with blessings, good wishes, love, and aspirations.

She’d list things like how she’s inspired by me and what she sees in me. Being a young woman going into the world, being deeply loved by my mother, my role model, and just being told that I am amazing, that I’ve got greatness in me, that the world is lucky to have me, was so validating. [In reverie]. She would write these cards, run out of space, and write on the back of the cards. She would write poetry for me and my dad. My dad once wrote, “You’re twelve years old now; maybe you can stop being so stupid” on the birthday card she had written for me. [Laughs hard] I still laugh at it to this day. I have kept all those cards. Oh, my dad is such a silly man.

Your mom’s death must have been like a bomb going off in your home.

Devastating. We’re just a nuclear family in Kenya. It’s always been just my brother, myself, and my parents. My mom was the one who would make plans and figure out where we would live and how we would pay bills. She was the breadwinner.

On a recent trip, I realised I’d have to buy flights and book hotels for my father. You know, because he cannot do that.[Chuckles] She was the grown-up. She was the one who would insist on when we would get together whenever there was something important to talk about, what the family needed to do, think about, and pray about. She was a voracious reader and spiritual in a very intellectual sense.

My father’s very ritualistic. He’ll go to the temple, ring the bell, and pour milk daily. My mom would tell us about Jesus and the Sikh gods and say, “Well, why do we light a fire and hold it throughout the house? Why do we light incense sticks? And why do we ring bells?”

How has your dad survived without her?

I think 2020 was a challenging year for a lot of elderly people. For a widower, it was very tough. I think about my mom often, but he thinks about her constantly. He talks about things she would say or approve of or what would irritate her. He kisses her photos, tiny little kisses. [Pensive pause] He loves her deeply. [Pause] For a while, I resented that love as I had boyfriends who would constantly disappoint me. [Chuckles]

What kind of teenager were you?

I was such a terrible teenager. I apologised to my mother all her life for being so bad. I was angry a lot of the time for reasons I felt were good. No one knew why I was rebellious. I would often lie to my parents, sneak out, be in places where I shouldn’t be, try smoking, and have the worst boyfriends.

I put them [parents] through it. When I was getting married, my best friend said, “It’s a good thing you don’t need a hen night, because that’s what your whole life has been”. [Laughs hysterically]. But I really worried my parents. They had a lot of sleepless nights, wondering when I would be home.

What have been some of the notable headwinds of your life?

The death of my mom. Again, like coming back to coins, every coin has a different side to it, right? Her death was devastating, but out of that, I found genuine kindness from strangers and volunteers who came to the morgue and helped me wash her body and dress her up. Did you know that’s a thing people volunteer for? Her death showed me the kindness in humanity.

Nivi Sharma is the CEO at Bridges to Prosperity. PHOTO | POOL

If you were to apologise to one person, who would that be?

[Long pause] It would be some friends I’ve lost along the way. I’m turning 40 soon and through my 30s, I’ve deepened how I think about and navigate friendships. I don’t have many friends, maybe one or two friends I could call in the middle of the night to bury a body.

I’ve walked away from a lot of friendships without having important conversations. Maybe I’ve hurt those people. I also think of past romantic relationships as well. I’ve been flippant in ending relationships that didn’t align with mine. I don’t know if that’s a function of being an Aquarius, being able to move on. But I think I’ve hurt a lot of people. I would apologise to these people.

Do you feel a shift as you approach 40?

I think 40 is a powerful time in a woman’s life. There’s so much written about menopause, which I’m not at yet there, but as women, one of the interesting side effects of menopause that is not spoken about enough is your oestrogen makes you nice to people, and so as women hit menopause, their nonsense detector gets really honed in. When you see more women leaving their husbands and filing for divorce, it really is a function of not having enough oestrogen. [Chuckles] So, I think the shift I’m seeing is being more selective with who I allow into my space and more gracious and understanding.

Your parents set a benchmark for relationships. Were you looking for your father in the man to marry?

Two young fish swimming through the water meet an older fish who says, ‘Good morning, how’s the water?’ The two fish swim on, and one turns and asks the other, ‘What water?’ That’s a good way of explaining how your parents’ relationship shapes what you think relationships should be, whether abusive or loving.

I didn’t see many other couples growing up because we didn’t have a huge social circle or a big family. I always said, ‘I’m going to marry a man who’s got a big career, and the financial burden should not fall on me to be the sole breadwinner.’

Looking at my dad’s flaws - forgetfulness, etc - I was going to marry an organised man, but on the other side of the coin, a man beautiful in personality, a generous human man like my dad. But then it all changed, and at some point, I was sure the non-negotiables were not about money or ambition.

I never heard my father raise his voice, let alone his hand, or swear at my mother. And I can’t imagine my husband or a partner doing that. And maybe that’s why I’ve had so many failed relationships: You raised a voice, and I was a foot out. My husband is a beautiful, kind, and loving man who has never changed his true nature, so yes, I married my father. [Laughs]

How did you two meet?

During the Constitution referendum. I had organised an election observation, and he was one of the volunteers. A few years later, I was having a Kenya Jubilee housewarming party, and I invited him. The dress code theme was gold, so he came carrying a Tullamore Dew whisky. He hung out in the kitchen (he loves to cook) where on the blackboard wall, which featured a chapati-maker at the top, he drew graffiti around it and wrote the words ‘Jackpot!” [Laughs]

After a week or two of dating, we both knew we had found ‘the one’. He took me on his motorbike, a Honda, to a tea plantation in Limuru, where he proposed. It’s the same motorbike we rode on our wedding day. Even eight years after our wedding, I still feel he is ‘the one’. We still acknowledge to each other how lucky we are to have this kind of love. He’s a very kind and loving soul, a brilliant cook, and a beautiful father to our daughter. I’m lucky.

Penalties for illegal State actions breach Sh126bn,others,"Economy Penalties for illegal State actions breach Sh126bn

Attorney General Justin Muturi. FILE PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG

By CONSTANT MUNDA

Penalties and fines arising from contract breaches, unlawful dismissals, human rights violations and other legal disputes committed by government officials increased nearly Sh18 billion in William Ruto’s first year in office, further burdening taxpayers.

Historical court awards against State ministries, departments and agencies climbed to an estimated Sh126.20 billion last financial year ended June 2023, analysis of sector budget reports indicate.

The value represents a jump of 16.50 percent over an estimated Sh108.32 billion the year before, signalling the growing cost of unlawful decisions made by public officers. Some of the awards represent cases determined three decades ago.

The bills, disclosed through sector expenditure proposals presented to the Treasury ahead of budgetary allocation for the financial year starting July, present a major strain on the country’s already fragile financial position. The reports show the government has paid Sh11.39 billion of the awards, representing 9.03 percent of the outstanding arrears.

The penalties against illegal actions by the State continue to mount despite Attorney-General Justin Muturi's warning last year that accounting officers may in future be sanctioned for breaching agreements with contractors and employees.

Accounting officers in public sectors are largely principal secretaries in ministries and chief executives of parastatals.

The unlawful decisions by officers have become a major liability to the Exchequer, with the awards now a key driver of pending bills for the national and county governments.

The Budget and Appropriation Committee of the National Assembly in 2021, for instance, estimated potential compensation for ongoing litigation in local and international courts at about Sh1.2 trillion from Sh809 billion in 2019.

“Greater vigilance is required to control the escalation. I am addressing the issue using various strategies which I am not at liberty to discuss,” Mr Muturi told the Business Daily in January 2023, adding that the awards were in excess of Sh150 billion at the time.

“Going forward I may be forced to recommend that State officers who are shown to be reckless in decision-making assume personal liability in certain instances. I believe that the government as a whole is obligated to protect public resources while contracting third parties, be they local or international.”

Reached for comment on the latest development, the government’s chief legal adviser referred this publication to Charles Mutinda, head of the General Civil Law and Claims Section at the State Law Office.

Mr Mutinda said growth in court awards against government ministries and departments—where the AG’s office is directly involved—are on a downward trend.

He hinted the higher value than a year earlier, as presented in the sector budget proposals, could include decisions against semi-autonomous State-owned enterprises, which are governed by independent boards.

Records at the AG’s office show that historical decisions against the government, which involve monetary awards amounted to Sh93.3 billion last October, the top legal counsel said, without providing the numbers for the previous year.

Read: PSs face fines as awards against State hit Sh150 billion

“We only deal with mainstream government, that is, ministries and departments,” Mr Mutinda told the Business Daily.

“However, we have a few State corporations that request our assistance and where there are awards against them, we capture the same.”

The data from the AG’s office shows that the Sh93.3 billion was awarded in 510 historical cases where the court decisions went against the State.

However, two cases account for more than 90 percent of the claims.

These are Sh53.6 billion awarded to Equip Agencies against the Ministry of Health and Sh33.35 billion to Nguruman Ltd against the Attorney-General over the invasion of more than 200 acres of land in Kajiado, according to Mr Mutinda.

The award to Equip Agencies has rocketed from Sh1.86 billion in 1999 when it was first given.

The State has appealed both determinations. For instance, the hearing of the appeal against Equip Agencies is set for January 30, this year.

“We have enhanced advisory, especially on contract implementation to avert claims and we also continue to strengthen the [AG’s] office through additional human resource capacity, funding and decentralization,” Mr Mutinda said.

“The corporations, on the other hand, are required to inform the AG of any major litigation they are facing for information and guidance.”

The analysis of the reports presented to the Treasury shows the Health sector has the largest share of court awards (Sh40.95 billion—a figure which smaller than that provided by the AG’s office), followed Energy, Infrastructure and ICT sector (Sh36.81 billion), while Agriculture’s claims were estimated at Sh26 billion.

The concern over mounting claims and the need for accounting officers to take “personal responsibility” to ease the rising burden on taxpayers started taking shape during the reign of predecessor AG Paul Kihara back in 2020.

Also read: Judiciary revenues up 10pc to Sh2.6bn as fines, fees rise

“The tendency with government officials to have a ‘Laissez-faire’ attitude in making unlawful decisions should be strongly discouraged and such officers penalised accordingly,” Mr Kihara wrote in a publication by the State Law Office in 2020.

“This reduces the mentality amongst government officials that an offence so committed it is the government, which is the defendant and not the officer as a person.”

Kenya in 2020 engaged about 700 lawyers from the State Law Office to battle a huge backlog of cases in local and international courts.

Tullow Oil plans to retain its annual spending on Kenya’s oil project at Sh1.6 billion ($10 million), pointing to a sustained interest in the project that has dragged on for years since the discovery was made in 2012.

The British oil explorer in the latest trading update said it plans to trim its overall capital spending across countries it has a presence in from $380 million (Sh61.95 billion) to $250 million (Sh40.76 billion) as it takes a drilling break in Ghana.

Kenya’s budget for this year is the same as that spent last year and will be equal to four percent of Tullow’s planned overall capital spending.

Tullow will in March formally issue the full-year trading results, in which it is expected to give further details on the progress of Kenya’s oil project. The project has suffered several setbacks, delaying key decisions.

TotalEnergies and Africa Oil Corp, who held a 25 percent stake each in project oil Kenya, pulled out in May last year, over what was explained as “differing internal strategic reasons,” leaving the London-listed firm alone in the oilfields.

The withdrawal of the two firms left Tullow as the sole partner in the project, a development it said created a more flexible proposition for a strategic partnership. Tullow said it was continuing with discussions with several interested parties.

There has also been a delay in getting approval on its final field development plan (FDP)—a document that outlines how Tullow intends to develop the oil fields, forecasts for production and costs, as well as how it plans to manage the impact of the project on the environment and society

Tullow had together with TotalEnergies and Africa Oil Corp, in March last year, submitted the plan for approval to the Energy Ministry and the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, before the two partners pulled out.

The plan was based on a life of field resource of 585 million barrels gross, initial plateau production of 120,000 barrels of oil per day, and capital investment of $3.4 billion (Sh554.3 billion) for the first oil.

Tullow was expecting the approval process, including ratification by Parliament, to conclude last year but this did not happen, even as its two partners pulled out.

The firm said the exit of two partners led to a re-assessment of risks associated with reaching a final investment decision, resulting in a $9 million (Sh1.47 billion) impairment.

CMA to expand over the counter bond trading,economy,"Capital Markets CMA to expand over the counter bond trading

The Capital Markets Authority is overseeing the expansion of over-the-counter bond trading in the secondary market as part of measures to establish a reliable yield curve by reducing inefficiencies.

According to the capital markets regulator, the initiative will include easing licensing for securities dealers who primarily engage in the over-the-counter (OTC) bond market where buyers and sellers engage directly including negotiating prices.

OTC bond deals have been stifled by elaborate licensing of players that has resulted in just four entities getting the nod.

They are Standard Chartered Bank, SBM, Kingdom Securities and investment advisory firm Private Wealth Management.

“The process of licensing can be very involving and so, we are making it easier so that they can take up that licence,” CMA chief executive officer Wycliffe Shamiah said on Thursday.

Without adequate dealers, off-market bond deals have been forced to be cleared through intermediaries in the organised Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE).

Read: CMA tightens rules to check directors and stockbrokers

At present, only the EABX Group Plc, a company that proposes to establish and operate an over-the-counter exchange in East Africa, has applied to be an authorised securities dealer.

“If you have huge players like banks who want to transact among themselves, they may negotiate the transaction and price the deals but the rules dictate that they go through members of the exchange to complete the transaction. This has brought a bit of inefficiencies,” added Mr Shamiah.

Further to increasing the number of authorised securities dealers, the CMA says it is working with the NSE to improve the exchange’s own Unquoted Securities Platform (USP) that has a window for off-market bond trades.

The revamp is expected to include the creation of new rules and a system that will allow players to provide two-way quotes on securities during pre and post-trade sessions.

“We have asked the NSE to come up with specific OTC rules for bonds,” added CMA director of policy and market development Luke Ombara.

Currently, the USP's listings are Acorn investment/development real estate investment trusts, the Linzi Sukuk and Laptrust’s real estate investment trust while the market has been described as fairly illiquid.

The National Treasury is eager for the reforms to widen off-market bond trading as it seeks to deepen the domestic securities market.

Automated exchange

“We will further enhance the market infrastructure through policy support to market participants to operationalise an over-the-counter automated exchange to complement the broker-intermediate NSE,"" the Treasury told IMF.

""The aim of the exchange will be to promote trading transparency and settlement efficiency and attract more capital in the economy, eventually leading to reduction of yields and cost of new public debt issues.""

Bond trading in the secondary market has come under sharp focus in the past year as rising interest rates in the primary auctions distort pricing in the secondary market.

New Sh70bn bond tests resolve to cut domestic debt,economy,"Capital Markets New Sh70bn bond tests resolve to cut domestic debt

The government is seeking Sh70 billion in an infrastructure bond (IFB) sale that will test the resolve of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to keep the cost of domestic borrowing in check.

The eight-and-a-half-year infrastructure bond, which is the second of its type being sold in the current fiscal year, has been floated in a period of heavy maturities of government debt, underperforming revenue collection and external borrowing, raising the pressure on CBK to take up expensive bids in bond sales.

The bond will be on sale until February 14, having hit the market on Wednesday.

In February, domestic debt service obligations—maturities plus coupon payments—are estimated at Sh280.9 billion, nearly half of which lies on maturities of the 91-day Treasury bill.

The Treasury’s latest statement of revenue and expenditure (for December 2023) showed that the tax revenue for the first six months of the fiscal year stood at Sh1.05 trillion, equivalent to 42 percent of the full-year target of Sh2.49 trillion.

Read: CBK faces upward rates pressure in January bond sales

Analysts have also pointed to the tougher stance taken by investors in the January bond sale as an indicator that investors will continue demanding a premium for lending to the government.

In the January bond that sought Sh35 billion, the CBK was forced to leave Sh12 billion on the table from bids of Sh37.2 billion in the initial sale after some investors asked for more than 19 percent in interest.

In the subsequent Sh15 billion tap sale meant to mop up the rejected bids, investors offered Sh11.8 billion.

“The trend, at a time when the fiscal agent is behind its domestic borrowing schedule, could force the CBK to continue accepting aggressive investor bids which portend higher pressure on domestic interest rates in the near/medium-term,” said analysts at NCBA Capital.

The tax-free infrastructure bonds—which are not benchmark bonds— have, however, tended to be an outlier in terms of interest rates compared to normal fixed-term bonds.

The 6.5-year November IFB for instance paid investors an average return of 17.93 percent. An ordinary bond of a similar tenor, which carries a tax obligation of 10 percent on interest would need to pay 19.92 percent to give an investor a net return that is equivalent to that of the IFB.

This attractive tax-free return has made infrastructure bonds popular with both local and foreign investors, with the latter usually taking less interest in ordinary bonds.

The November IFB, which sought Sh50 billion on the initial sale, raised bids worth Sh88.9 billion out of which the CBK took up Sh67.1 billion.

Despite the oversubscription and acceptance of a higher-than-targeted amount, the Treasury rolled out a tap sale on the offer that sought Sh25 billion but ended up raking in Sh47.8 billion from investors after yet another oversubscription.

This bodes well for the Treasury’s efforts to raise a substantial share of its Sh471.4 billion net domestic borrowing target for the current fiscal year from the February IFB.

Joshua Oigara has completed one year as the CEO of Stanbic Bank Kenya and South Sudan, leading the Kenyan business in posting a nine-month net profit that was more than what was recorded in the full year ended December 2022.

Mr Oigara spoke to the Business Daily about his journey at Stanbic, what worked for the bank in 2023, his view on 2024 and how the bank is responding to challenges such as elevated interest rates and increased defaults.

You have closed over a year at Stanbic since moving from KCB Group. How has the journey been like?

It has been quite exciting. The possibilities for Stanbic Bank and Standard Bank [parent company of Stanbic] on the continent are immense. If you look at the opportunities of transforming lives, bringing in new clients and connecting dots across the continent, I wouldn’t have joined Stanbic at a better time.

The more I reflect on the challenges of the continent, the more I realise Stanbic has a chance to play in moving the continent forward.

Your 2023 nine-month results reflected a 34 percent rise in profits, racing past the full year for 2022. What worked for you in a year earnings for many of Stanbic peers were slowing down?

What I loved most in the nine months was the strong growth in client activities such as trade and investment. Our performance was as a result of strong fundamentals and managing our risk much more clearly even as the cost of funds increased.

Where we saw weaknesses is the area of increased interest rates. But we took a lot of opportunities to support our clients early enough. We started preparing in March 2023 on how to support clients facing less disposable income and higher taxes

A lot of people spoke about the challenging macroeconomic environment, high inflation, high-interest rates and depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against foreign currencies. But I would say, generally in the business cycle, there are headwinds.

The cycles are part of the nuances of the economy. Our challenge is to be prepared from a risk model to take advantage of such cycles.

By preparing early enough, we were able to ride the wave we faced. I don’t think we are there yet. This may take another year or two to resolve.

What are some of the support measures you are taking to support clients who are running into difficulties of servicing loans?

Additional facilities for individuals, additional working capital facilities for our enterprise clients, SMEs and large clients and being able to accommodate those who need extended periods to service their loans. We have refinanced through top-up facilities for those who need to settle old loans.

We have also accommodated price increases. We haven’t passed the full cost increase to clients. If you look at the rising central bank rate (CBR), the bank has had to accommodate customers by absorbing part of the cost of funds.

Despite the support to customers, Stanbic had by the third quarter of 2023 increased provisioning for loan defaults. What was the thinking behind this and what’s your view in the New Year?

Risk management in a difficult environment is one of the greatest strengths an institution should have. We see the headwinds. Our clients are facing pressure. Their income levels are coming under a lot of attack from different areas.

If you are an SME moving goods from one area to another, your transport costs have gone up, power costs have increased and yet you are not really pricing up your goods. We have also had sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing where we have faced difficulties with some of our clients.

High-interest rates mean there is a likelihood of more defaults. We anticipate clients will face such difficulties and so when we do forward modelling, we realise we need to increase our level of provisioning.

It is probably the highest provisioning we have held as a bank in the last three or four years but we expect this to ease in 2024 or 2025. My view is that this environment we are in is not short-term.

After three upward CBR reviews in 2023, what is your take on the direction of interest rates going forward?

Do we anticipate interest rates to come down? I think we do in the medium term. I can’t tell you if it’s happening in 2024 or 2025 but I think once inflation is down then we should begin to see this easing.

Central Bank of Kenya closed 2023 with a CBR rise that took the figure to levels seen 11 years ago. This is a new pressure point for borrowers. How do you see this playing out?

This is not a new chapter. When you create new limits, you create new possibilities for clients. Rising interest rates will bring in more pressure for clients but the clients and banks are very dynamic.

As a bank, we haven’t been able to pass the full cost of the increase in funds to clients given the CBR review. I don’t think this will happen even with the new rate.

We will continue to support our clients by engaging them to know what we can offer in line with their cash flow positions. The underlying business position of our clients has not changed. What has changed is their cost profile.

Large clients are prepared to remodel their finances while private customers have flexibility within themselves to balance price increases. We are seeing more pressure on mass market clients like SMEs.

I think we will come out much stronger as an industry by working closer with our clients. We just need to be more cautious and proactive in supporting our clients.

Interest rates are going up, the shilling is weakening against the dollar and job stability is threatened. Are we at that point where banks have to activate the strategies that worked during Covid-19 pandemic?

There are many shocks in the financial sector than we always imagine, only that we remember big bang like Covid-19 and the financial crisis, Russia-Ukraine war and now the Israel-Hamas situation.

The situation we are in has progressed gradually unlike the Covid-19 shock. The adjustment we needed to make is what you have seen the CBK do and we are very much aligned to it.

We have known how to support our clients through a crisis and so I don’t think the current crisis is to the magnitude of Covid-19. Having said that, the value of non-performing loans in the industry are currently at their highest levels ever and the way to get out of it is to stay closer to our clients.

Our clients’ level of imagination and their energy towards their businesses is what defines why we exist. So, staying close to them and making sure we walk with them through the crisis is key. That is what we are doing at Stanbic and we are projecting our NPLs ratio will come down in 2024 because we are able to work with clients through this cycle.

Looking at South Sudan and the businesses that operate their, including Stanbic, is it almost just a case of keeping the lights on? What are the prospects?

To the contrary, we see relative stability in South Sudan than before. You can only get to feel the pulse of South Sudan when you visit Juba or Rumbek or go to Yei.

The amount of investment going on in sectors such as infrastructure, housing, education and healthcare is different from what people see today. The macroeconomic challenges and the level of currency depreciation is much less. We anticipate South Sudan to come out of hyperinflation by the end of 2024.

I am quite excited. Are we building our business? Yes. We opened up new sites of representation in 2022 and we intend to do much more. We are there for the long haul. The energy sector is a big part of our growth momentum and this is expected to continue growing.

We see international development organisations like United Nations and World Food Programme running and we are seeing huge investments in telecommunication coming up. We see bubbling economic activities than before.

Unfortunately, many Kenyan businesses are not represented in South Sudan. For me, it is a pity. It is a great opportunity just like the DRC Congo especially when you look at the volume of goods entering South Sudan.

There always questions about whether the country’s laws and regulations are moving fast enough. I think the answer is that it can get better.

One of the sticky problems is that of pending bills for people and businesses that do business with government. How do you see this playing out?

There are cases where clients are unable to get their payments but government ultimately settles the obligations. Pending bills is an old problem and I have no doubt it is going to be there in 2024. So it is the bridge-financing and working close with clients, especially the SMEs, to give them the support and accommodation they need.

The Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company (KMRC) is planning to return to the bond market to issue the second tranche of its Sh10.5 billion medium-term note to raise more funds for the disbursement of cheaper housing loans.

In a progress assessment report, the African Development Bank (AfDB), which has invested Sh15.8 billion in the company, said the mortgage financier is evaluating the market conditions to see if they will allow the issuance of their second bond this or next year.

Read: KMRC grows cheap home loans four-fold to Sh6.8bn

“During 2023, the macroeconomic condition has been challenging for bond issuance in part due to high interest rate, and inflation environment,” the bank said.

“Hence, KMRC has not been able to issue a follow-up tranche under the MTN program and continues to monitor the market conditions for possible bond issuance in 2024-2025.”

KMRC in February 2022 raised more than Sh1.4 billion from its first bond issuance as part of the Sh10.5 billion MTN that was to be raised from the domestic market within four years.

The initial bond diversifies the institution’s funding sources, ending its reliance on foreign development financial institutions and concessional lenders, which had been the primary source of funding for its refinancing activities since its establishment in 2018.

The money raised from the bond and other concessional lenders, including the World Bank, has so far enabled KMRC to refinance 3,142 mortgages valued at Sh9.6 billion as of September last year, AfDB said.

It is working with 12 primary mortgage lenders, which are also shareholders, allowing people to access mortgages at a rate of about 9.5 percent, less than the country’s average mortgage rate of 12.3 percent.

However, if the difficult conditions, characterised by high inflation and interest rates, persist, KMRC may not be able to issue the second bond this year or in 2025, impacting their ability to continue issuing affordable housing loans in the country, AfDB warned.

Kenya’s commercial property market remains in the doldrums, with the value of non-residential buildings approved in the 11 months ended November 2023 by Nairobi County falling below the pre-pandemic levels.

The latest data published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows that the value of non-residential buildings stood at Sh31.5 billion in the review period.

This was less than half of the Sh71.5 billion recorded in a similar period in 2019. The value of the approvals fell to Sh44.8 billion in the same period in 2020 and declined further to Sh26.5 billion before rising to Sh32.2 billion in 2021.

A few office developments were expected to be completed last year largely due to the historic oversupply, with investors wary of putting money in this class, said Knight Frank, a property consultancy, in a report for the first half of 2023.

Read: Nairobi suburbs post fastest land price surge in four years

“Additionally, the increasing cost of capital amidst struggle by developers to service their loans has made financial institutions very conservative in supporting large real estate developments, hence the subdued real estate activities,” said Knight Frank.

However, the market for residential buildings seems to be on a recovery path with KNBS showing that homes approved for construction in Nairobi in the review period rose to Sh163.6 billion. This is more than the Sh128.2 billion approved in 2019 and which was the previous peak.

Commercial property market, which had been roiled by oversupply before Covid-19 has been hit with a tough economic environment that has seen small businesses go for smaller spaces even as some companies adopt remote and co-working to cut costs.

“Even before the pandemic in 2019, there was already an oversupply of commercial and retail in this market,” said Johnson Denge, a real estate investment analyst.

“That accumulated with the issue of the pandemic which elevated the growth of e-commerce or online shopping and the market adopted what you call a kadogo economy (low-end consumer business),” said Mr Ndenge.

Mr Ndenge explained that small businesses were grappling with high operating costs and high taxes, pushing them to smaller spaces.

Moreover, with attractive returns from the risk-free government securities, a lot of investors have opted out of the riskier asset classes such as real estate.

Even as fewer commercial properties, which also include the retail market, a lot of non-residential buildings remained unoccupied even as prime office rents remained static at $1.2 per square foot per month in the first half of last year, according to Knight Frank.

Some of the major completions include Principal Place, Karen Green, PTA Complex, The Rock, The Piano, and The Cube.

The pick-up in the residential market is driven partly by the affordable housing approvals, said Mr Denge.

UK walks away from post-Brexit Canada trade talks ‘over hormones in beef’ – business live,economy,"02.55 EST UK-Canada trade talks break down in beef over cheese

The UK has walked away from post-Brexit trade talks with Canada in what one expert described as a “blow to the government’s trade story”.

Canada said the breakdown in talks came because the UK insisted on maintaining restrictions on its agricultural products, of which beef treated with hormones has been a persistent problem. The BBC on Friday reported that the beef dispute was a key factor in the failure of talks.

British cars will also face tariffs from the end of April when imported to Canada. Canada had already imposed a 245% tariff at the start of the year on British cheeses such as stilton and cheddar if they fell outside the already existing quota for non-EU imports.

In a statement posted on X, a British government spokesperson said “we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made”.

A spokesperson for Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said:

We are disappointed that negotiations with the UK are being paused. Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.

Ng’s UK counterpart, Kemi Badenoch, did not appear to have commented on the breakdown in talks by Friday morning. Badenoch has been seen as a contender for the Conservative party leadership if Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is pushed aside, in part because of her work on trade deals.

David Henig, UK director for the European Centre For International Political Economy, a trade-focused thinktank, said it was “little surprise” that the UK had failed to reach a deal with “persistently tough negotiating partners”. He added it was “a blow to the government’s trade story.”

Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens ‘wrongly fined for driving in London Ulez’,environment,"Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens were wrongly fined for driving in London’s Ulez clean air zone, according to European governments, in what has been described as “possibly one of the largest data breaches in EU history”.

The Guardian can reveal Transport for London (TfL) has been accused by five EU countries of illegally obtaining the names and addresses of their citizens in order to issue the fines, with more than 320,000 penalties, some totalling thousands of euros, sent out since 2021.

The Liberal Democrats’ transport spokesperson in the London assembly has called for an immediate investigation, saying the issue could damage the UK capital’s reputation as being open to visitors.

Since Brexit, the UK has been banned from automatic access to personal details of EU residents. Transport authorities in Belgium, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands have confirmed to the Guardian that driver data cannot be shared with the UK for enforcement of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), and claim registered keeper details were obtained illegally by agents acting for TfL’s contractor Euro Parking Collection.

In France, more than 100 drivers have launched a lawsuit claiming their details were obtained fraudulently, while Dutch lorry drivers are taking legal action against TfL over £6.5m of fines they claim were issued unlawfully.

According to the Belgian MP Michael Freilich, who has investigated the issue on behalf of his constituents, TfL is treating European drivers as a “cash cow” by using data obtained illegitimately to issue unjustifiable fines.

Many of the penalties have been issued to drivers who visited London in Ulez-compliant vehicles and were not aware they had to be registered with TfL’s collections agent Euro Parking at least 10 days before their visit.

Failure to register does not count as a contravention, according to Ulez rules, but some drivers have nonetheless received penalties of up to five-figure sums. TfL said the fines were justified because it was unable to confirm whether foreign vehicles had contravened emissions standards if they were not registered.

Has London’s Ulez become a magnet for conspiracy theories? – video

Some low-emission cars have been misclassed as heavy goods diesel vehicles and fined under the separate low-emission zone (Lez) scheme, which incurs penalties of up to £2,000 a day. Hundreds of drivers have complained that the fines arrived weeks after the early payment discount and appeals deadlines had passed.

One French driver was fined £25,000 for allegedly contravening Lez and Ulez rules, despite the fact his minibus was exempt.

Freilich has asked ministers to raise the issue during the current Belgian presidency of the Council of the EU. “This is possibly one of the largest privacy and data breaches in EU history, but so far no concrete action has been taken while responsibilities are being shunted on to drivers,” he said.

TfL said that despite an absence of individual data-sharing agreements with EU countries, “local laws” allowed authorities to share vehicle owner information with the UK for the enforcement of traffic regulations.

However, EU countries say national laws allow the UK to access personal data only for criminal offences, not civil ones. Breaching Ulez rules is a civil offence, while more risky behaviour such as speeding or driving under the influence of drink or drugs can be a criminal offence. This raises the question of whether Euro Parking can legally carry out its contract with TfL.

Euro Parking was awarded a five-year contract by TfL in 2020 to recover debts from foreign drivers who had breached congestion or emission zone rules.

The company, which is paid according to its performance, is estimated to have earned between £5m and £10m. It has the option to renew for a further five years.

The firm is owned by the US transport technology group Verra Mobility, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and headed by the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch executive David Roberts. The company’s net revenue was $205m (£161m) in the second quarter of 2023.

In October, the Belgian government ordered a criminal investigation after a court bailiff was accused of illegally passing the details of 20,000 drivers to Euro Parking for Ulez enforcement. The bailiff was suspended in 2022 and TfL initially claimed that no Belgian data had been shared with Euro Parking since then. However, a freedom of information request by the Guardian found that more than 17,400 fines had been issued to Belgians in the intervening 19 months.

TfL then claimed driver details were provided directly to Euro Parking by Belgium’s vehicle licensing agency. It has since told the Guardian they are obtained via a National Contact Point (NCP), a network of official information hubs for use by authorised agencies.

However, the Belgian minister for transport has confirmed that data cannot be shared directly or indirectly for Ulez enforcement. Last month, the Belgian data protection authority began an investigation into how the information was still being obtained.

Campaigners accuse Euro Parking of circumventing data protection rules by using EU-based agents to request driver data without disclosing that it is for UK enforcement.

Last year, an investigation by the Dutch vehicle licensing authority RDW found that the personal details of 55,000 citizens had been obtained via an NCP in Italy. “The NCP informed us that the authorised users have used the data in an unlawful way and stopped their access,” a spokesperson said.

The German transport authority KBA claimed that an Italian NCP was used to obtain information from its database. “Euro Parking obtained the data through unlawful use of an EU directive to facilitate the cross-border exchange of information about traffic offences that endanger road safety,” a KBA spokesperson said. “The directive does not include breaches of environmental rules.”

Spain’s transport department told the Guardian that UK authorities were not allowed access to driver details for Ulez enforcement. Euro Parking has sent more than 25,600 fines to Spanish drivers since 2021.

In France, 102 drivers have launched a lawsuit claiming that their details were fraudulently obtained. Romain Binelli, of the law firm Woog & Associés, who is representing the litigants, said: “The question is who could have accessed the information. Either Euro Parking and TfL have maintained their access to the vehicle database, which should have ended after Brexit, or they are paying someone to get the information. Drivers are receiving packets of 10 or more fines for monstrous amounts all at once, often well after the [deadline] date to contest them.”

TfL, speaking on behalf of Euro Parking, said: “Any company working on our behalf is contractually required to ensure that data is processed in line with the relevant data protection legislation. We work closely with European Parking Collection to ensure all elements of the contract are being adhered to and have mechanisms in place should they not be fulfilled.

“Euro Parking make it clear when they submit requests for keeper data in EU countries that they are acting on behalf of TfL, for enforcement of road-user charging in London, even when they route those requests through a third party. Euro Parking has not been prevented from accessing keeper data for drivers in EU countries.”

Caroline Pidgeon, the Lib Dem London assembly member and transport spokesperson, called for an immediate investigation after the Guardian shared its findings.

“It is extremely worrying to hear that TfL could be collecting its data from drivers unlawfully,” she said. “The extent of fines being issued to visitors from the EU, many incorrectly, demonstrates that the rules are not being communicated clearly to tourists, something which I have raised with TfL in the past only to be brushed off. If this issue is not solved urgently, it risks seriously damaging London’s reputation as being open to visitors.”","['euro', 'transport', 'fines', 'eu', 'driving', 'information', 'fined', 'drivers', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'ulez', 'citizens', 'wrongly', 'data', 'parking', 'london', 'tfl']"
